In <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">Mentor Graphics,</i> the court interpreted the claims in light of the specification, which expressly defined the medium as encompassing "any data storage device" including random-access memory and carrier waves.

Accordingly, because the BRI of the claims covered both subject matter that falls within a statutory category (the random-access memory), as well as subject matter that does not (the carrier waves), the claims as a whole were not to a statutory category and thus failed the first criterion for eligibility.<a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b146_25d3b_a7" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d24c02_117e0_13c" uri="d0e197244.html" note-title="2106 - Patent Subject Matter Eligibility" class="annotate-ok">With regard to the second criterion for eligibility, the <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">Alice/Mayo</i> test, claim interpretation can affect the first part of the test (whether the claims are directed to a judicial exception). For example, the patentee in <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">Synopsys</i> argued that the claimed methods of logic circuit design were intended to be used in conjunction with computer-based design tools, and were thus not mental processes. <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">Synopsys, Inc. v.

It is also not necessary to identify a "correct" category into which the claim falls, because although in many instances it is clear within which category a claimed invention falls, a claim may satisfy the requirements of more than one category.

Ct. at 2351-52, 110 USPQ2d at 1978-79. A computer system is used as a third-party intermediary between the parties to the exchange.

The patentee in <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">CyberSource</i> claimed a method for verifying the validity of a credit card transaction over the Internet, and a computer-readable medium comprising program instructions for performing the method. The method comprised obtaining information about other transactions that have utilized an Internet address identified with the credit card transaction to be verified, constructing a map of credit card numbers based on the other transactions, and utilizing the map to determine if the credit card transaction is valid. 654 F.3d at 1367-68, 99 USPQ2d at 1692. Although the patentee argued that the method could not be performed without the Internet, nothing in the claim required use of the Internet to obtain the data (as opposed to obtaining the data from a pre-compiled database). 654 F.3d at 1370, 99 USPQ2d at 1693. The court therefore concluded that the method could be performed in the human mind, or by a human using a pen and paper, and that the claim was therefore directed to a mental process of "obtain[ing] and compar[ing] intangible data pertinent to business risks." 654 F.3d at 1370 and 1372, 99 USPQ2d at 1694 and 1695. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_p_29a1e_1900c_297" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_p_29a1e_19084_169" uri="ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html" note-title="2106.04(a)(2) - Examples of Concepts The Courts Have                  Identified As Abstract Ideas" class="annotate-ok">Another example is <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">University of Utah Research Foundation v.

Ambry Genetics Corp.,</i> 774 F.3d 755, 113 USPQ2d 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The claimed primers were single-stranded pieces of DNA, each of which corresponded to a naturally occurring double-stranded DNA sequence in or near the BRCA genes. The patentee argued that these primers had markedly different structural characteristics from the natural DNA, because the primers were synthetically created and because "single-stranded DNA cannot be found in the human body". The court disagreed, concluding that the primers&#8217; structural characteristics were not markedly different than the corresponding strands of DNA in nature, because the primers and their counterparts had the same genetic structure and nucleotide sequence. 774 F.3d at 760, 113 USPQ2d at 1243-44. The patentee also argued that the primers had a different function than when they are part of the DNA strand because when isolated as a primer, a primer can be used as a starting material for a DNA polymerization process. The court disagreed, because this ability to serve as a starting material is innate to DNA itself, and was not created or altered by the patentee: <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_p_29a1f_210f1_203" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <blockquote id="ch2100_d29a1f_2117a_358">  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_p_29a1f_21164_bb" uri="ch2100_d29a1b_13bc1_b1.html" note-title="2106.04(c) - The Markedly Different Characteristics               Analysis" class="annotate-ok">In fact, the naturally occurring genetic sequences at issue here do not perform a significantly new function. Rather, the naturally occurring material is used to form the first step in a chain reaction--a function that is performed because the primer maintains the exact same nucleotide sequence as the relevant portion of the naturally occurring sequence. One of the primary functions of DNA&#8217;s structure in nature is that complementary nucleotide sequences bind to each other. It is this same function that is exploited here--the primer binds to its complementary nucleotide sequence.

The applicant argued that the clones, including Dolly, were eligible because they were created via human ingenuity, and had phenotypic differences such as shape, size and behavior compared to their donors. The court was unpersuaded, explaining that the clones were exact genetic replicas of the donors and thus did not possess markedly different characteristics. 750 F.3d at 1337, 110 USPQ2d at 1671-72 ("Roslin&#8217;s chief innovation was the preservation of the donor DNA such that the clone is an exact copy of the mammal from which the somatic cell was taken.

When addressing a rebuttal argument, for example, a manual or handbook showing conventional computer components or functions could be used to refute an argument that using a certain additional computer element is not routine. Another source could be a patent that illustrates the state of the art, such as a background discussion of conventional components or actions routinely taken. The evidence would not be used to show a lack of novelty, which is not part of the Step 2B inquiry, but rather to show the state of the art. Another source of evidence is a court decision.

Third, <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302376.html">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b>&nbsp; defines which categories of inventions are eligible for patent protection. An invention that is not a machine, an article of manufacture, a composition or a process cannot be patented.

Fourth, <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302376.html">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b>&nbsp; serves to ensure that patents are granted on only those inventions that are "useful."

Thus, to satisfy the requirements of <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302376.html">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b>, an applicant must claim an invention that is statutory subject matter and must show that the claimed invention is "useful" for some purpose either explicitly or implicitly. Application of this latter element of <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302376.html">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b>&nbsp; is the focus of these guidelines.<a style="display:none;" href="d0e198706" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="d0e198754" uri="d0e198682.html" note-title="2107.01 - General Principles Governing Utility Rejections" class="annotate-ok">Deficiencies under the "useful invention" requirement of <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302376.html">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b>&nbsp; will arise in one of two forms.

For example, indicating that a compound may be useful in treating unspecified disorders, or that the compound has "useful biological" properties, would not be sufficient to define a specific utility for the compound. See, e.g., <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">In re Kirk,</i> 376 F.2d 936, 153 USPQ 48 (CCPA 1967); <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">In re Joly,</i> 376&nbsp;F.2d 906, 153 USPQ 45 (CCPA 1967).

A general statement of diagnostic utility, such as diagnosing an unspecified disease, would ordinarily be insufficient absent a disclosure of what condition can be diagnosed. Contrast the situation where an applicant discloses a specific biological activity and reasonably correlates that activity to a disease condition. Assertions falling within the latter category are sufficient to identify a specific utility for the invention.

Thus a "substantial utility" defines a "real world" use. Utilities that require or constitute carrying out further research to identify or reasonably confirm a "real world" context of use are not substantial utilities. For example, both a therapeutic method of treating a known or newly discovered disease and an assay method for identifying compounds that themselves have a "substantial utility" define a "real world" context of use. An assay that measures the presence of a material which has a stated correlation to a predisposition to the onset of a particular disease condition would also define a "real world" context of use in identifying potential candidates for preventive measures or further monitoring.

One example is inventions to be used in a research or laboratory setting. Many research tools such as gas chromatographs, screening assays, and nucleotide sequencing techniques have a clear, specific and unquestionable utility (e.g., they are useful in analyzing compounds). An assessment that focuses on whether an invention is useful only in a research setting thus does not address whether the invention is in fact "useful" in a patent sense. Instead, Office personnel must distinguish between inventions that have a specifically identified substantial utility and inventions whose asserted utility requires further research to identify or reasonably confirm. Labels such as "research tool," "intermediate" or "for research purposes" are not helpful in determining if an applicant has identified a specific and substantial utility for the invention. <a style="display:none;" href="d0e198937" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>    <div id="d0e198940" uri="d0e198682.html" note-title="2107.01 - General Principles Governing Utility Rejections" class="annotate-ok"> <h2> II.  				&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> WHOLLY INOPERATIVE INVENTIONS; "INCREDIBLE" UTILITY</b> <a style="display:none;" href="d0e198940" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></img></a></h2> </div>    <p xmlns="" align="left" id="d0e198944" uri="d0e198682.html" note-title="2107.01 - General Principles Governing Utility Rejections" class="annotate-ok">An invention that is "inoperative" (i.e., it does not operate to produce the results claimed by the patent applicant) is not a "useful" invention in the meaning of the patent law.

Each claim (i.e., each "invention"), therefore, must be evaluated on its own merits for compliance with all statutory requirements. Generally speaking, however, a dependent claim will define an invention that has utility if the independent claim from which the dependent claim depends is drawn to the same statutory class of invention as the dependent claim and the independent claim defines an invention having utility. An exception to this general rule is where the utility specified for the invention defined in a dependent claim differs from that indicated for the invention defined in the independent claim from which the dependent claim depends. Where an applicant has established utility for a species that falls within an identified genus of compounds, and presents a generic claim covering the genus, as a general matter, that claim should be treated as being sufficient under <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302376.html">35 U.S.C. 101</a></b>.

The claims were properly rejected on prior art because there was no new feature of physical structure and no new relation of printed matter to physical structure. For example, a claimed measuring tape having electrical wiring information thereon, or a generically claimed substrate having a picture of a golf ball thereupon, would lack a functional relationship as the claims as a whole are directed towards conveying wiring information (unrelated to the measuring tape) or an aesthetically pleasing image (unrelated to the substrate) to the reader.

After the thermoplastic adheres to the metal fastener, the end product is cooled by quenching in water. The examiner made a rejection based on a U.S. patent to Barnes. Barnes taught a self-locking fastener in which the patch of thermoplastic was made by depositing thermoplastic powder on a metallic fastener which was then heated. The end product was cooled in ambient air, by cooling air or by contacting the fastener with a water trough.

Cir. 2011), is instructive as to the "reasonably pertinent" prong for determining whether a reference is analogous art. In determining whether a reference is reasonably pertinent, an examiner should consider the problem faced by the inventor, as reflected - either explicitly or implicitly - in the specification. In order to support a determination that a reference is reasonably pertinent, it may be appropriate to include a statement of the examiner's understanding of the problem. The question of whether a reference is reasonably pertinent often turns on how the problem to be solved is perceived. If the problem to be solved is viewed in a narrow or constrained way, and such a view is not consistent with the specification, the scope of available prior art may be inappropriately limited.

It is also noted that evidence submitted after final rejection may be denied entry into the record.

Pavement Salvage Co.,</i> 396 U.S. 57, 163 USPQ 673 (1969) was a paving machine which combined several well-known elements onto a single chassis. Standard prior art paving machines typically combined equipment for spreading and shaping asphalt onto a single chassis. The patent claim included the well-known element of a radiant-heat burner attached to the side of the paver for the purpose of preventing cold joints during continuous strip paving. The prior art used radiant heat for softening the asphalt to make patches, but did not use radiant heat burners to achieve continuous strip paving.

The invention involved applying enteric coatings to a drug in pill form for the purpose of ensuring that the drug did not disintegrate before reaching its intended site of action. The drug at issue was omeprazole, the generic name for gastric acid inhibitor marketed as Prilosec&#174;. The claimed formulation included two layers of coatings over the active ingredient. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0b2_fc" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0b2_10b" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The district court found that Astra&#8217;s patent in suit was infringed by defendants Apotex and Impax. The district court rejected Apotex&#8217;s defense that the patents were invalid for obviousness. Apotex had argued that the claimed invention was obvious because coated omeprazole tablets were known from a prior art reference, and because secondary subcoatings in pharmaceutical preparations generally were also known. There was no evidence of unpredictability associated with applying two different enteric coatings to omeprazole. However, Astra&#8217;s reason for applying an intervening subcoating between the prior art coating and omeprazole had been that the prior art coating was actually interacting with omeprazole, thereby contributing to undesirable degradation of the active ingredient. This degradation of omeprazole by interaction with the prior art coating had not been recognized in the prior art. Therefore, the district court reasoned that based on the evidence available, a person of ordinary skill in the art would have had no reason to include a subcoating in an omeprazole pill formulation. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0b2_10b" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0e0_3b9" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court&#8217;s decision that the claimed invention was not obvious. Even though subcoatings for enteric drug formulation were known, and there was no evidence of undue technical hurdles or lack of a reasonable expectation of success, the formulation was nevertheless not obvious because the flaws in the prior art formulation that had prompted the modification had not been recognized. Thus there would have been no reason to modify the initial formulation, even though the modification could have been done. Moreover, a person of skill in the art likely would have chosen a different modification even if they had recognized the problem.<a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0e0_3b9" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0e8_11f" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok"> Office personnel should note that in this case the modification of the prior art that had been presented as an argument for obviousness was an extra process step that added an additional component to a known, successfully marketed formulation. The proposed modification thus amounted to extra work and greater expense for no apparent reason. This is not the same as combining known prior art elements A and B when each would have been expected to contribute its own known properties to the final product. In the <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">Omeprazole</i> case, in view of the expectations of those of ordinary skill in the art, adding the subcoating would not have been expected to confer any particular desirable property on the final product. Rather, the final product obtained according to the proposed modifications would merely have been expected to have the same functional properties as the prior art product. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0e8_11f" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0eb_29f" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The Omeprazole case can also be analyzed in view of the discovery of a previously unknown problem by the patentee.

However, since the problem had not been previously known, there would have been no reason to incur additional time and expense to add another layer, even though the addition would have been technologically possible. This is true because the prior art of record failed to mention any stability problem, despite the acknowledgment during testimony at trial that there was a known theoretical reason that omeprazole might be subject to degradation in the presence of the known coating material.<a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0eb_29f" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  </div>  <div id="ch2100_d24bfd_17020_1c4" class="Example"><b>Example 4:</b>   <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0f4_177" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The case of <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">Crocs, Inc. v.

A strap also made of foam was attached to the foot opening of the upper, such that the strap could provide support to the Achilles portion of the wearer&#8217;s foot. The strap was attached via connectors that allowed it to be in contact with the base section, and to pivot relative to the base section. Because both the base portion and the strap were made of foam, friction between the strap and the base section allowed the strap to maintain its position after pivoting. In other words, the foam strap did not fall under the force of gravity to a position adjacent to the heel of the base section. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0f4_181" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_1e0fa_2ad" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the claims were obvious over the combination of two pieces of prior art.

There was testimony in the record that the loose fit of the heel strap made the shoe more comfortable for the wearer than prior art shoes in which the heel strap was constantly in contact with the wearer&#8217;s foot. In the claimed footwear, the foam heel strap contacted the wearer&#8217;s foot only when needed to help reposition the foot properly in the shoe, thus reducing wearer discomfort that could arise from constant contact. This desirable feature was a result of the friction between the base section and the strap that kept the strap in place behind the Achilles portion of the wearer&#8217;s foot.

The first improvement was a removable sleeve that could be placed over the shank of the hitch pin lock so that the same lock could be used with towing apertures of varying sizes. The second improvement was an external flat flange seal adapted to protect the internal lock mechanism from contaminants. Wyers had admitted that each of several prior art references taught every element of the claimed inventions except for the removable sleeve and the external covering. Master Lock had argued that these references, in combination with additional references teaching the missing elements, would have rendered the claims obvious. The court first addressed the question of whether the additional references relied on by Master Lock were analogous prior art. As to the reference teaching the sleeve improvement, the court concluded that it dealt specifically with using a vehicle to tow a trailer, and was therefore in the same field of endeavor as Wyers&#8217; sleeve improvement. The reference teaching the sealing improvement dealt with a padlock rather than a lock for a tow hitch. The court noted that Wyers&#8217; specification had characterized the claimed invention as being in the field of locking devices, thus at least suggesting that the sealed padlock reference was in the same field of endeavor. However, the court also observed that even if sealed padlocks were not in the same field of endeavor, they were nevertheless reasonably pertinent to the problem of avoiding contamination of a locking mechanism for tow hitches. The court explained that the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in KSR "directs [it] to construe the scope of analogous art broadly." <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">Id.</i> at 1238, 95 USPQ2d at 1530.

With regard to the sleeve improvement, it pointed out that the need for different sizes of hitch pins was well known in the art, and that this was a known source of inconvenience and expense for users. The court also mentioned the marketplace aspect of the issue, noting that space on store shelves was at a premium, and that removable sleeves addressed this economic concern. As to the sealing improvement, the court pointed out that both internal and external seals were well-known means to protect locks from contaminants. The court concluded that the constituent elements were being employed in accordance with their recognized functions, and would have predictably retained their respective functions when combined as suggested by Master Lock.

Rather, the court explained why a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention, in view of the facts relevant to the case, would have found the claimed inventions to have been obvious. The key to supporting any rejection under <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302450.html">35 U.S.C. 103</a></b>&nbsp; is the clear articulation of the reason(s) why the claimed invention would have been obvious.

Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc.,</i> 567 F.3d 1314, 90 USPQ2d 1865 (Fed. Cir. 2009), was directed to a polyaxial pedicle screw used in spinal surgeries that included a compression member for pressing a screw head against a receiver member. A prior art reference (Puno) disclosed all of the elements of the claim except for the compression member. Instead, the screw head in Puno was separated from the receiver member to achieve a shock absorber effect, allowing some motion between receiver member and the vertebrae. The missing compression member was readily found in another prior art reference (Anderson), which disclosed an external fracture immobilization splint for immobilizing long bones with a swivel clamp capable of polyaxial movement until rigidly secured by a compression member. It was asserted during trial that a person of ordinary skill would have recognized that the addition of Anderson&#8217;s compression member to Puno&#8217;s device would have achieved a rigidly locked polyaxial pedicle screw covered by the claim. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_24b4d_125" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_24b4d_134" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">In conducting its analysis, the Federal Circuit noted that the "predictable result" discussed in <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">KSR</i> refers not only to the expectation that prior art elements are capable of being physically combined, but also that the combination would have worked for its intended purpose. In this case, it was successfully argued that Puno "teaches away" from a rigid screw because Puno warned that rigidity increases the likelihood that the screw will fail within the human body, rendering the device inoperative for its intended purpose. In fact, the reference did not merely express a general preference for pedicle screws having a "shock absorber" effect, but rather expressed concern for failure and stated that the shock absorber feature "decrease[s] the chance of failure of the screw of the bone-screw interface" because "it prevent[s] direct transfer of load from the rod to the bone-screw interface." Thus, the alleged reason to combine the prior art elements of Puno and Anderson&#8212;increasing the rigidity of the screw&#8212;ran contrary to the prior art that taught that increasing rigidity would result in a greater likelihood of failure. In view of this teaching and the backdrop of collective teachings of the prior art, the Federal Circuit determined that Puno teaches away from the proposed combination such that a person of ordinary skill would have been deterred from combining the references as proposed. Secondary considerations evaluated by the Federal Circuit relating to failure by others and copying also supported the view that the combination would not have been obvious at the time of the invention. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_24b4d_134" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  </div>   <div id="d0e209698" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok"> <h2>  B.   				&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> <i>Simple Substitution of One Known Element for Another To Obtain Predictable Results</i> </b> <a style="display:none;" href="d0e209698" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></img></a></h2> </div>    <p xmlns="" align="left" id="d0e209702" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok"> To reject a claim based on this rationale, Office personnel must resolve the <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">Graham</i> factual inquiries.

The dual-action spring reduced the force required to open the bed from the closed position, while reducing the force required to lift the bed from the open position. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_24cb4_75" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_24cb4_80" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The Federal Circuit addressed the propriety of making the combination since Teague was in a different field than the application. Teague was found to be reasonably pertinent to the problem addressed in the application because the folding mechanism did not require any particular focus on treadmills, but rather generally addressed problems of supporting the weight of such a mechanism and providing a stable resting position. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_24cb4_80" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_24cbf_86" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The court also considered whether one skilled in the art would have been led to combine the teachings of Damark and Teague. Appellant argued that Teague teaches away from the invention because it directs one skilled in the art not to use single-action springs and does not satisfy the claim limitations as the dual-action springs would render the invention inoperable. The Federal Circuit considered these arguments and found that, while Teague at most teaches away from using single-action springs to decrease the opening force, it actually instructed that single-action springs provide the result desired by the inventors, which was to increase the opening force provided by gravity. As to inoperability, the claims were not limited to single-action springs and were so broad as to encompass anything that assists in stably retaining the tread base, which is the function that Teague accomplished. Additionally, the fact that the counterweight mechanism from Teague used a large spring, which appellant argued would overpower the treadmill mechanism, ignores the modifications that one skilled in the art would make to a device borrowed from the prior art. One skilled in the art would size the components from Teague appropriately for the application.<a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_24cbf_86" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_24cdd_137" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok"> <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"> ICON</i> is another useful example for understanding the scope of analogous art.

At trial, the witnesses consistently testified that the properties of risedronate were not expected, offering evidence that researchers did not predict either the potency or the low dose at which the compound was effective. Tests comparing risedronate to a compound in the prior art reference showed that risedronate outperformed the other compound by a substantial margin, could be administered in a greater amount without an observable toxic effect, and was not lethal at the same levels as the other compound. The weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses were sufficient to show unexpected results that would have rebutted an obviousness determination.

The court pointed out that little weight was to be afforded to the commercial success because the competing product was also assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble. However, the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court&#8217;s conclusion that risedronate met a long-felt, but unsatisfied need. The court rejected Teva&#8217;s contention that because the competing drug was available before Actonel7, there was no unmet need that the invention satisfied. The court emphasized that whether there was a long-felt but unsatisfied need is to be evaluated based on the circumstances as of the filing date of the challenged invention &#8211; not as of the date that the invention is brought to market. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_24fcc_24d" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_24fe3_6c" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">It should be noted that the lead compound cases do not stand for the proposition that identification of a single lead compound is necessary in every obviousness rejection of a chemical compound. For example, one might envision a suggestion in the prior art to formulate a compound having certain structurally defined moieties, or moieties with certain properties. If a person of ordinary skill would have known how to synthesize such a compound, and the structural and/or functional result could reasonably have been predicted, then a <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">prima facie</i> case of obviousness of the claimed chemical compound might exist even without identification a particular lead compound. As a second example, it could be possible to view a claimed compound as consisting of two known compounds attached via a chemical linker. The claimed compound might properly be found to have been obvious if there would have been a reason to link the two, if one of ordinary skill would have known how to do so, and if the resulting compound would have been the predictable result of the linkage procedure. Thus, Office personnel should recognize that in certain situations, it may be proper to reject a claimed chemical compound as obvious even without identifying a single lead compound. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_24fe3_6c" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  </div>  <div id="ch2100_d24bfd_17383_31a" class="Example"><b>Example 11:</b>   <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_24ff8_14d" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The decision reached by the Federal Circuit in<i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"> Altana Pharma AG v.

The Federal Circuit determined that ample evidence supported the district court&#8217;s finding that compound 12 was a natural choice for further development.

Johnston,</i> 425 U.S. 219, 189 USPQ 257 (1976) was directed towards a system (i.e., computer) for automatic record keeping of bank checks and deposits. In this system, a customer would put a numerical category code on each check or deposit slip. The check processing system would record these on the check in magnetic ink, just as it does for amount and account information. With this system in place, the bank can provide statements to customers that are broken down to give subtotals for each category. The claimed system also allowed the bank to print reports according to a style requested by the customer. As characterized by the Court, "[u]nder respondent&#8217;s invention, then, a general purpose computer is programmed to provide bank customers with an individualized and categorized breakdown of their transactions during the period in question." <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">Id.</i> at 222, 189 USPQ at 259. <a style="display:none;" href="d0e209922" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="d0e209931" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok"> BASE SYSTEM - The nature of the use of data processing equipment and computer software in the banking industry was that banks routinely did much of the record-keeping automatically. In routine check processing, the system read any magnetic ink characters identifying the account and routing. The system also read the amount of the check and then printed that value in a designated area of the check. The check was then sent through a further data processing step which used the magnetic ink information to generate the appropriate records for transactions and for posting to the appropriate accounts. These systems included generating periodic statements for each account, such as the monthly statement sent to checking account customers.<a style="display:none;" href="d0e209931" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="d0e209934" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok"> IMPROVED SYSTEM - The claimed invention supplemented this system by recording a category code which could be used to track expenditures by category. Again, the category code will be a number recorded on the check (or deposit slip) which will be read, converted into a magnetic ink imprint, and then processed in the data system to include the category code. This enabled reporting of data by category as opposed to only allowing reporting by account number. <a style="display:none;" href="d0e209934" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="d0e209937" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok"> KNOWN TECHNIQUE - This is an application of a technique from the prior art &#8211; the use of account numbers (generally used to track an individual's total transactions) to solve the problem of how to track categories of expenditures to more finely account for a budget. That is, account numbers (identifying data capable of processing in the automatic data processing system) were used to distinguish between different customers. Furthermore, banks have long segregated debits attributable to service charges within any given separate account and have rendered their customers subtotals for those charges. Previously, one would have needed to set up separate accounts for each category and thus receive separate reports. Supplementing the account information with additional digits (the category codes) solved the problem by effectively creating a single account that can be treated as distinct accounts for tracking and reporting services. That is, the category code merely allowed what might previously have been separate accounts to be handled as a single account, but with a number of sub-accounts indicated in the report. <a style="display:none;" href="d0e209937" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="d0e209940" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The basic technique of putting indicia on data to enable standard sorting, searching, and reporting yielded no more than the predictable outcome which one of ordinary skill would have expected to achieve with this common tool of the trade and was therefore an obvious expedient.

The applicant argued that modifying the primary reference in the manner suggested by the secondary reference would forego the benefits taught by the primary reference, thereby teaching away from the combination. The court found there was sufficient motivation to combine because both references recognized reaction time and degree of hydrolysis as result-effective variables, which can be varied to have a predictable effect on the final product; and the primary reference does not contain an express teaching away from the proposed modification.

Finding that the district court had correctly determined that there was no interference-in-fact because Rolls-Royce&#8217;s claims would not have been obvious in light of United&#8217;s application, the Federal Circuit affirmed. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_25385_387" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_25385_398" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The Federal Circuit described the fan blade of the count as follows: <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_25385_398" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <blockquote id="ch2100_d24bfd_17477_b9">  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_25389_3c7" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">Each fan blade has three regions &#8211; an inner, an intermediate, and an outer region.

The Federal Circuit disagreed with United&#8217;s assessment that the claimed fan blade would have been obvious based on an obvious to try rationale.

The last option corresponded to the fourth step of the invention as claimed. <a style="display:none;" href="ch2100_d1b1a1_253de_398" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="ch2100_d1b1a1_253eb_339" uri="d0e209516.html" note-title="2143 - Examples of Basic Requirements of a Prima Facie         Case of Obviousness " class="annotate-ok">The Federal Circuit noted that based on "simple logic," selecting a new list of recipients was more likely to result in the desired outcome than resending to those who had not received the email on the first attempt.

The throttle controlled the combustion process and the available power generated by the engine. Newer cars used computer controlled throttles in which a sensor detected the motion of the pedal and sent signals to the engine to adjust the throttle accordingly. At the time of the invention, the marketplace provided a strong incentive to convert mechanical pedals to electronic pedals, and the prior art taught a number of methods for doing so. The prior art (Asano) taught an adjustable pedal with a fixed pivot point with mechanical throttle control. The prior art (&#8216;936 patent to Byler) taught an electronic pedal sensor which was placed on a pivot point in the pedal assembly and that it was preferable to detect the pedal&#8217;s position in the pedal mechanism rather than in the engine.

Specifically, a patent to Zehender, which was relied upon to reject applicant&#8217;s claim, included a statement that the thickness of the protective layer "should be not less than about [100 Angstroms]." The court held that the patent did not teach away from the claimed invention. "Zehender suggests that there are benefits to be derived from keeping the protective layer as thin as possible, consistent with achieving adequate protection. A thinner coating reduces light absorption and minimizes manufacturing time and expense. Thus, while Zehender expresses a preference for a thicker protective layer of 200-300 Angstroms, at the same time it provides the motivation for one of ordinary skill in the art to focus on thickness levels at the bottom of Zehender&#8217;s &#8216;suitable&#8217; range- about 100 Angstroms- and to explore thickness levels below that range. The statement in Zehender that &#8216;[i]n general, the thickness of the protective layer should be not less than about [100 Angstroms]&#8217; falls far short of the kind of teaching that would discourage one of skill in the art from fabricating a protective layer of 100 Angstroms or less.

The composition was created from antibody molecules that include three fragments, F(ab)2, F(ab) and F(c), which have separate properties and utilities. There have been commercially available antivenom products that consisted of whole antibodies and F(ab)2 fragments, but researchers had not experimented with antivenoms containing only F(ab) fragments because it was believed that their unique properties would prevent them from decreasing the toxicity of snake venom. The inventor, Sullivan, discovered that F(ab) fragments are effective at neutralizing the lethality of rattlesnake venom, while reducing the occurrence of adverse immune reactions in humans.

The evidence included three expert declarations submitted to show that the prior art taught away from the claimed invention, an unexpected property or result from the use of F(ab) fragment antivenom, and why those having ordinary skill in the art expected antivenoms comprising F(ab) fragments to fail. The declarations related to more than the use of the claimed composition. While a statement of intended use may not render a known composition patentable, the claimed composition was not known, and whether it would have been obvious depends upon consideration of the rebuttal evidence. Appellant did not concede that the only distinguishing factor of its composition is the statement of intended use and extensively argued that its claimed composition exhibits the unexpected property of neutralizing the lethality of rattlesnake venom while reducing the occurrence of adverse immune reactions in humans.

Second, the AIA adopts a global view of prior art disclosures and thus does not require that a public use or sale activity be "in this country" to be a prior art activity.

Conception does not occur unless one has a mental picture of the structure of the chemical, or is able to define it by its method of preparation, its physical or chemical properties, or whatever characteristics sufficiently distinguish it. It is not sufficient to define it solely by its principal biological property, e.g., encoding human erythropoietin, because an alleged conception having no more specificity than that is simply a wish to know the identity of any material with that biological property. We hold that when an inventor is unable to envision the detailed constitution of a gene so as to distinguish it from other materials, as well as a method for obtaining it, conception has not been achieved until reduction to practice has occurred, i.e., until after the gene has been isolated."

For inventions in an unpredictable art, adequate written description of a genus which embraces widely variant species cannot be achieved by disclosing only one species within the genus. See, e.g., <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">Eli Lilly,</i> 119&nbsp;F.3d at 1568, 43 USPQ2d at 1406. Instead, the disclosure must adequately reflect the structural diversity of the claimed genus, either through the disclosure of sufficient species that are "representative of the full variety or scope of the genus," or by the establishment of "a reasonable structure-function correlation." Such correlations may be established "by the inventor as described in the specification," or they may be "known in the art at the time of the filing date." See <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">AbbVie,</i> 759 F.3d at 1300-01, 111 USPQ2d 1780, 1790-91 (Fed.

Description of a representative number of species does not require the description to be of such specificity that it would provide individual support for each species that the genus embraces. For example, in the molecular biology arts, if an applicant&nbsp;disclosed an amino acid sequence, it would be unnecessary to provide an explicit disclosure of nucleic acid sequences that encoded the amino acid sequence. Since the genetic code is widely known, a disclosure of an amino acid sequence would provide sufficient information such that one would accept that an applicant was in possession of the full genus of nucleic acids encoding a given amino acid sequence, but not necessarily any particular species.

Calgene, Inc.,</i> 188&nbsp;F.3d 1362, 52 USPQ2d 1129 (Fed.

Both specifications disclosed applying antisense technology in regulating three <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise">E. coli</i> genes. Despite the limited disclosures, the specifications asserted that the "[t]he practices of this invention are generally applicable with respect to any organism containing genetic material which is capable of being expressed &#8230; such as bacteria, yeast, and other cellular organisms." Thus, the court construed the claims to encompass the application of antisense methodology in a broad range of organisms. Ultimately, the court relied on the fact that (1) the amount of direction presented and the number of working examples provided in the specification were very narrow compared to the wide breadth of the claims at issue, (2) antisense gene technology was highly unpredictable, and (3) the amount of experimentation required to adapt the practice of creating antisense DNA from <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"> <i>E. coli</i> </i> to other types of cells was quite high, especially in light of the record, which included notable examples of the inventor&#8217;s own failures to control the expression of other genes in <i xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"> <i>E. coli</i> </i> and other types of cells.

The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be evidenced by a variety of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the specification, drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the meaning of a claim term is the specification - the greatest clarity is obtained when the specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms.

For example, a genus claim that covers multiple species is broad, but is not indefinite because of its breadth, which is otherwise clear. But a genus claim that could be interpreted in such a way that it is not clear which species are covered would be indefinite (e.g., because there is more than one reasonable interpretation of what species are included in the claim).<a style="display:none;" href="d0e217782" title="Add a Note" class="note-toggle"><img src="/resource/images/icon_note.png"></a></p>  <p xmlns="" align="left" id="d0e217794" uri="d0e217778.html" note-title="2173.04 - Breadth Is Not Indefiniteness" class="annotate-ok">Undue breadth of the claim may be addressed under different statutory provisions, depending on the reasons for concluding that the claim is too broad.

The lack of clarity could arise where a claim refers to "said lever" or "the lever," where the claim contains no earlier recitation or limitation of a lever and where it would be unclear as to what element the limitation was making reference. Similarly, if two different levers are recited earlier in the claim, the recitation of "said lever" in the same or subsequent claim would be unclear where it is uncertain which of the two levers was intended. A&nbsp;claim which refers to "said aluminum lever," but&nbsp;recites only "a lever" earlier in the claim, is indefinite because it is uncertain as to the lever to which reference is made. Obviously, however, the failure to provide explicit antecedent basis for terms does not always render a claim indefinite.

The first presumption is that use of the word "means" or "step" in a claim creates a rebuttable presumption that the claim element is to be treated in accordance with <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">35 U.S.C. 112(f)</a></b>&nbsp; or <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302824.html">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, sixth paragraph. The presumption is rebutted when "means" or "step" is not modified by function or when the function is recited with sufficient structure or material within the claim itself to perform the recited function. The second presumption is that absence of the word "means" or "step" in a claim creates a rebuttable presumption that the claim element is not to be treated in accordance with <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec">35 U.S.C. 112(f)</a></b>&nbsp; or <b xmlns="urn:us:gov:doc:uspto:enterprise"><a href="#//d0e302824.html">pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112</a></b>, sixth paragraph.
