In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which of the following
 fees may not be reduced by 50 percent for “small entities”?
"
"
(A) The basic filing fee for a design patent application. 
(B) The fee for a disclaimer. 
(C) The fee for a petition for an extension of time. 
(D) The fee for recording a document affecting title. 
(E) The maintenance fee due at 3 years and six months after grant.
"
"


(D) is the most correct answer. 35 USC § 41(h); MPEP §§ 302.06; 509.02. 35 USC § 41(h) specifies that
 the fees “charged under subsection (a) or (b) shall be reduced by 50 percent with respect to their application
 to any small business concern as defined under section 3 of the Small Business Act, and to any independent
 inventor or nonprofit organization as defined in regulations issued by the Director.” Since the fee
 for a document affecting title is charged pursuant to 35 USC § 41(d)(1), it not subsection (a) or (b),
 and it is not entitled to a small entity discount. See also MPEP 509.02, which states, “[o]ther fees,
 established under section 41 (c) or (d) of Title 35, United States Code, are not reduced for small entities
 since such a reduction is not permitted or authorized by Public Law 97-247. Fees which are not reduced
 include . . . miscellaneous fees and charges, 37 CFR 1.21.” Fees for recording documents affecting title
 are set under 37 CFR § 1.21(h). See MPEP § 302.06.

A registered practitioner files an international application submission that includes a description,
 claims and drawings in the United States Receiving Office (RO/US) on Wednesday, January 8, 2003. The
 submission did not include the required request, international and search fees, or the designation of
 a PCT contracting State. The RO/US mails an ""Invitation to Correct the Purported International Application,""
 dated January 10, 2003, to the practitioner indicating that the designation of at least one Contracting
 State, as required by PCT Article 11(1)(iii)(b), was not included. A one-month period for response is
 set in the Invitation. On Monday, February 10, 2003, the practitioner submits by facsimile a designation
 sheet of the Request Form designating every available Contracting State, and authorization to charge
 all required fees. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP,
 will the application be accorded an international filing date?
"
"
(A) Yes. The application will be accorded a filing date of January 8, 2003. 
(B) Yes. The application will be accorded an international filing date of February 10, 2003 
(C) No. The application will not be accorded an international filing date because the failure to designate
 at least one contracting State cannot be cured by a facsimile transmission. 
(D) No. The application was given a one-month period for response. The practitioner would have had to
 have filed the response on Friday, February 7, 2003 in order to have been timely. 
(E) None of the above.
"
"


(C) is the correct answer. 37 CFR §§ 1.6(d)(3) and 1.8(a)(2)(i)(d); MPEP § 502 (reproducing Rule 1.6(d)(3));
 MPEP § 512 (reproducing Rule 1.8(a)(2)(i)(d)); and MPEP §1817.01. As stated in MPEP § 1817.01, ""[a]ll
 designations must be made in the international application on filing; none may be added later."" The
 application will not be accorded an international filing date since the practitioner has tried to cure
 the failure to designate at least one contracting State by filing a paper using facsimile which is not
 permitted according to 37 CFR §§ 1.6(d)(3) and 1.8(a)(2)(i)(d).

Prior to filing a patent application for a client, a registered practitioner determined that the client
 was entitled to claim small entity status under 37 CFR 1.27. The practitioner filed a patent application
 for the client on November 1, 2002 together with a claim for small entity status under 37 CFR 1.27.
 On December 2, 2002, a Notice to File Missing Parts was mailed setting a two month period for reply
 and requiring the basic filing fee and the surcharge under 37 CFR 1.16(e). The practitioner timely submitted
 the small entity fees for the basic filing fee and the surcharge as required in the Notice. Shortly
 thereafter, the practitioner discovered that on October 31, 2002, the day before the application was
 filed, the client, without advising the practitioner, had assigned all rights in the invention that
 is the subject of the application to an entity that would not qualify for small entity status under
 37 CFR 1.27. In accordance with the USPTO rules and the procedures set forth in the MPEP, which of the
 following actions would be the best action for the practitioner to take?
"
"
(A) File a continuing application under 37 CFR 1.53(b) with the large entity filing fee and then file
 a letter of express abandonment under 37 CFR 1.138 in the original application after the continuing
 application has been accorded a filing date. 
(B) Promptly file a notification of loss of small entity status under 37 CFR 1.27(g) and, thereafter,
 pay large entity fees whenever any subsequent fees are required. 
(C) Wait until a Notice of Allowance is received and then timely submit the large entity issue fee along
 with a notification of loss of small entity status under 37 CFR 1.27(g). 
(D) File a paper under 37 CFR 1.28(c) requesting that the good faith error in claiming small entity status
 be excused and complying with the separate submission and itemization requirements of 37 CFR 1.28(c)
 and including payment of the deficiency owed. 
(E) Pay the difference between the large entity filing fee and small entity filing fee and the difference
 between the large entity surcharge and small entity surcharge within two months from the mail date of
 the Notice to File Missing Parts.
"
"


(D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 509.03, under the heading ""Correcting Errors In Small Entity Status,""
 states ""37 CFR 1.28(c) provides that if small entity status is established in good faith and the small
 entity fees are paid in good faith, and it is later discovered that such status as a small entity was
 established in error or through error the Office was not notified of a change of status, the error will
 be excused upon compliance with the separate submission and itemization requirements of 37 CFR 1.28(c)(1)
 and (c)(2), and the deficiency payment requirement of 37 CFR 1.28(c)(2).""

In accordance with the MPEP and USPTO rules and procedure, correspondence transmitted to the USPTO by
 facsimile is not permitted in certain situations. Which of the following facsimile transmissions to
 the USPTO will be accorded a date of receipt by the USPTO?
"
"
(A) Facsimile transmission of a request for reexamination under 37 CFR 1.510 or 1.913. 
(B) Facsimile transmission of drawings submitted under 37 CFR 1.81, 1.83 through 1.85, 1.152, 1.165,
 1.174, or 1.437. 
(C) Facsimile transmission of a response to a Notice of Incomplete Nonprovisional Application for the
 purpose of obtaining an application filing date. 
(D) Facsimile transmission of a correspondence to be filed in a patent application subject to a secrecy
 order under 37 CFR 5.1 through 5.5 and directly related to the secrecy order content of the application.
 
(E) Facsimile transmission of a continued prosecution application under 37 CFR 1.53(d) and an authorization
 to charge the basic filing fee to a deposit account.
"
"


Choice (E) is the correct answer. MPEP § 502.01, and 37 CFR § 1.6(d)(3). MPEP § 502.01 reads, “The date
 of receipt accorded to any correspondence permitted to be sent by facsimile transmission, including
 a continued prosecution application (CPA) filed under 37 CFR § 1.53(d), is the date the complete transmission
 is received by an Office facsimile unit...An applicant filing a CPA by facsimile transmission must include
 an authorization to charge the basic filing fee to a deposit account or to a credit card.”

 Relative To Patents And Patent Applications Where Filing By Facsimile Transmission Is Not Permitted,”
 identifies among the correspondence not permitted to be filed by facsimile transmission “ (B) A national
 patent application specification and drawing (provisional or nonprovisional) or other correspondence
 for the purpose of obtaining an application filing date, other than a continued prosecution application
 filed under 37 CFR 1.53(d)”

In accordance with the USPTO rules and the procedures set forth in the MPEP, which of the following papers
 is precluded from receiving the benefit of a certificate of mailing or transmission under 37 CFR 1.8?
"
"
(A) An amendment, replying to an Office action setting a period for reply, transmitted by mail with a
 certificate of mailing to the USPTO from a foreign country. 
(B) An amendment, replying to an Office action setting a period for reply, transmitted by facsimile with
 a certificate of transmission to the USPTO from a foreign country. 
(C) An information disclosure statement (IDS) under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98 transmitted after the first
 Office action.

 not apply to papers mailed in a foreign country.” (B) is not correct. See MPEP § 512. Certificate of
 transmission procedure applies to correspondence transmitted to the Office from a foreign country and
 an amendment is not prohibited from being transmitted by facsimile and is not precluded from receiving
 the benefits under 37 CFR § 1.8.

509.03. Parties who can sign and file the written assertion. The written assertion can be signed by:
 an attorney or agent registered with the Office), who can also file the written assertion; At least
 one of the individuals identified as an inventor (even though an executed oath or declaration has not
 been submitted), who can also file the written assertion pursuant to the exception under § 1.33(b) of
 this part; or An assignee of an undivided part interest, but the partial assignee cannot file the assertion
 without resort to a party identified above. New determination of entitlement to small entity status
 is needed when issue and maintenance fees are due. Once status as a small entity has been established
 in an application or patent, fees as a small entity may thereafter be paid in that application or patent
 without regard to a change in status until the issue fee is due or any maintenance fee is due.

 § 3.73(b) of this chapter notwithstanding, who can also file the written assertion; (ii) At least one
 of the individuals identified as an inventor (even though a § 1.63 executed oath or declaration has
 not been submitted), notwithstanding § 1.33(b)(4), who can also file the written assertion pursuant
 to the exception under § 1.33(b) of this part; or (iii) An assignee of an undivided part interest, notwithstanding
 §§ 1.33(b)(3) and 3.73(b) of this chapter, but the partial assignee cannot file the assertion without
 resort to a party identified under § 1.33(b) of this part. (g)(1) New determination of entitlement to
 small entity status is needed when issue and maintenance fees are due. Once status as a small entity
 has been established in an application or patent, fees as a small entity may thereafter be paid in that
 application or patent without regard to a change in status until the issue fee is due or any maintenance
 fee is due.
