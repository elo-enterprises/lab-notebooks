Inventor Joe is anxious to get a patent with the broadest claim coverage possible for the invention.
 Joe retained a registered practitioner, Jane, to obtain the advantage of legal counsel in obtaining
 broad protection. Jane filed a patent application for the invention. The inventor heard that, although
 patent prosecution is conducted in writing, it is possible to get interviews with examiners. Joe believes
 an interview might hasten the grant of a patent by providing the examiner a better understanding of
 the true novelty of the invention. Which of the following are consistent with the patent law, rules
 and procedures as related by the MPEP regarding usage of interviews?
"
"
(A) Prior to the first Office action being mailed the inventor calls the examiner to whom the application
 is docketed to offer help in understanding the specification. 
(B) After receiving the first Office action Jane calls the examiner for an interview for the purpose
 of clarifying the structure and operation of the invention as claimed and disclosed, because the examiner's
 analysis regarding patentability in the rejection is novel and suggests that the examiner is interpreting
 the claimed invention in a manner very different from the inventor's intent. 
(C) Jane has Larry, a registered practitioner in the Washington D.C. area, who is more familiar with
 interview practice to call the examiner. Jane gives Larry a copy of the first Office action, which suggests
 that the primary examiner's analysis is incorrect, and offers to explain why. Jane instructs Larry that
 because Larry is unfamiliar with the inventor, Larry should not agree to possible ways in which the
 claims could be modified, or at least indicate to the examiner that Jane would have to approve of any
 such agreement. 
(D) Jane calls the primary examiner after receiving the final rejection, demanding that the examiner
 withdraw the finality of the final action. When the examiner states that the final rejection is proper,
 Jane demands an interview as a matter of right to explain the arguments. 
(E) (B) and (D).
"
"


(B) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 713.01, under the heading ""Scheduling And Conducting An Interview,""
 states ""[a]n interview should be had only when the nature of the case is such that the interview could
 serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner
 and the applicant, and thereby advance the prosecution of the application.""

Smith's first invention is a new method of fabricating a semiconductor capacitor in a dynamic random
 access memory (DRAM) cell. Smith filed a first patent application on December 13, 2001 disclosing and
 claiming the first invention. Smith's later, second invention, is an improved semiconductor capacitor
 in a DRAM cell and a method of making it. Smith filed a second application on December 16, 2002, claiming
 the benefit of the filing date of the copending first application. The second application contains claims
 1-20, and a specification that provides support for the claimed subject matter in compliance with 35
 USC 112, first paragraph. In the second application, claims 1-10 are drawn to Smith's first invention,
 and claims 11-20 are drawn to Smith's second invention. The primary examiner found a non patent printed
 publication authored by Jones published on February 4, 2002. The article discloses the both of Smith's
 inventions. Which of the following courses of action by the examiner would be in accord with the patent
 laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP?
"
"
(A) The examiner can reject claims 1-20 in the second application using the article because the publication
 date of the article is earlier than the filing date of the second application. 
(B) The examiner cannot reject any of the claims in the second application using the article because
 the second application claims the benefit of the filing date of the first application. 
(C) The examiner can reject claims 1-20 in the second application using the article because the second
 application is not entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the first application since the second
 application was filed more than one year from the filing date of the first application. 
(D) The examiner can reject claims 1-10, but cannot reject claims 11-20 in the second application because
 the first application did not disclose the improved capacitor set forth in claims 11-20. 
(E) The examiner cannot reject claims 1-10, but can reject claims 11-20 in the second application because
 the first application did not disclose an improved capacitor set forth in claims 11-20.
"
"


The most correct answer is (E). See MPEP § 201.11, under the heading ""VI. When Not Entitled To Benefit
 Earlier Of Filing Date, "" states ""[a]ny claim in a continuation-in-part application which is directed
 solely to subject matter adequately disclosed under 35 USC 112 in the parent nonprovisional application
 is entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the parent nonprovisional application. However, if
 a claim in a continuation-in-part application recites a feature which was not disclosed or adequately
 supported by a proper disclosure under 35 USC 112 in the parent nonprovisional application, but which
 was first introduced or adequately supported in the continuationin-part application such a claim is
 entitled only to the filing date of the continuation-inpart application. See In re Chu, 66. F.3d 292,
 36 USPQ2d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1995) and Transco Products, Inc. v. Performance Contracting Inc., 38 F.3d
 551, 32 USPQ2d 1077 (Fed. Cir. 1994)."" Accordingly, claims 1-10 are entitled to the benefit of the filing
 date of the first application, but claims 11-20 are not entitled to the benefit of the filing date of
 the first application because claims 11-20 recite an improved capacitor, which was not disclosed in
 the first application. Claims 1-10 have an effective filing date earlier than the publication date of
 the article. Claims 11-20 have a filing date later than the publication date of the article. For 35
 USC 102(a) to apply, the reference must have a publication date earlier in time than the effective filing
 date of the application. See MPEP 706.02(a), paragraph ""III. 35 USC 102(a).""

Patent application A was filed on January 12, 1995, containing claims 1-10. A primary examiner rejects
 the claims under 35 USC 102(b) as being anticipated by a U.S. patent issued on June 2, 1992. The rejection
 also relies on a technical paper published March 12, 1993 to show that a characteristic is inherent
 in the patent, although not expressed in its disclosure. According to the patent laws, rules and procedures
 as related in the MPEP, which of the following actions is most likely to overcome the rejection?
"
"
(A) Filing a declaration and exhibits under 37 CFR 1.131 to antedate the reference U.S. patent. 
(B) Filing evidence under 37 CFR 1.132 tending to show commercial success of the invention. 
(C) Filing evidence under 37 CFR 1.132 tending to show unexpected results of the invention. 
(D) Amending the specification of application A to claim priority under 35 USC 120 by a specific reference
 to a prior copending application B that was filed before June 2, 1992 by the same inventor and discloses
 the invention claimed in at least one claim of application A in the manner provided by the first paragraph
 of 35 USC 112. 
(E) Submitting arguments pointing out that the rejection under 35 USC 102(b) relies on more than one
 reference.
"
"


(D) is most correct. MPEP § 706.02(b) (8th ed., Rev. 1) states that “[a] rejection based on 35 USC §
 102(b) may be overcome by...(C) perfecting priority under...35 USC § 120 by amending the specification
 of the application to contain a specific reference to a prior application...” Answer (A) is incorrect
 because a declaration and evidence filed under 37 CFR § 1.131 cannot antedate a reference that qualifies
 as prior art under 35 USC § 102(b), a statutory bar. See 37 CFR § 1.131(a); MPEP § 715, “SITUATIONS
 WHERE 37 CFR 1.131 AFFIDAVITS OR DECLARATIONS ARE INAPPROPRIATE.”

When, in accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, is a supplemental
 oath or declaration treated as an amendment under 37 CFR 1.312?
"
"
(A) When filed in a nonprovisional application after the Notice of Allowance has been mailed. 
(B) When filed in a reissue application at any point during the prosecution. 
(C) When filed in a nonprovisional application after the payment of the Issue Fee. 
(D) When filed in a reissue application after the Notice of Allowance has been mailed. 
(E) (A) and (D).
"
"


(D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 714.16, third paragraph, states ""a supplemental reissue oath or
 declaration is treated as an amendment under 37 CFR 1.312 because the correction of the patent which
 it provides is an amendment of the patent, even though no amendment is physically entered into the specification
 or claim(s).""

A registered practitioner filed a patent application in the Office in 1999. Following examination and
 a final rejection, the practitioner timely filed a proper notice of appeal and a proper appeal brief
 in the application wherein claims 1-3 stand rejected, claims 4 and 5, which depend from claim 1, stand
 objected to as depending from a rejected claim but are otherwise allowable, and claims 6-10 stand allowed.
 The appeal involves claims 1-3. After the brief was filed but prior to a decision by the Board of Patent
 Appeals and Interferences, the practitioner filed a request for continued examination (RCE) with a submission
 in accordance with 37 CFR 1.114 without paying the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e). In accordance with
 the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, what effect does the filing of the RCE
 without the fee set forth in Rule 1.17(e) have on the application under appeal?
"
"
(A) The application is abandoned. 
(B) The application is still pending and under appeal awaiting a decision by the Board of Patent Appeals
 and Interferences, because the RCE was improper. 
(C) The application is still pending; the appeal is considered withdrawn and the application will be
 passed to issue with claims 1-3 canceled and claims 4-10 allowed. 
(D) The application is still pending; the appeal is considered withdrawn and the application will be
 passed to issue with claims 1-5 canceled and claims 6-10 allowed. 
(E) The appeal is withdrawn; the application is returned to the primary examiner and prosecution is reopened
 as to claims 1-10.
"
"


(D) is the correct answer. See MPEP §§ 706.07(h), under the heading ""X. After Appeal But Before Decision
 By Board,"" and 1215.01. As explained in MPEP § 1215.01, ""The filing of an RCE will be treated as a withdrawal
 of the appeal by the applicant, regardless of whether the RCE includes the appropriate fee or a submission.""
 Thus, the filing of the RCE without the fee results in the withdrawal of the appeal in this application
 and passage of the application to issue with the allowed claims 6-10 after the cancellation of both
 rejected claims 1-15 and claims 4 and 5 which are allowable except for their dependency from rejected
 claim 1.

Applicant filed an application containing a claim directed to a polishing wheel coated with diamond grit
 particles. The application discloses, but does not claim, a diamond grit particle size of 5-7 microns.
 The examiner rejected the claim under 35 USC 102(b) as being anticipated by a U.S. patent which disclosed
 as its invention a polishing wheel in accordance with the claim of the application but coated with glass
 grit particles instead of diamond grit particles. The applied patent, which issued more than 1 year
 prior to the effective filing date of the application, also disclosed that diamond grit particles were
 known for coating on polishing wheels but were inferior to glass grit particles because they were more
 expensive and did not adhere as well to the polishing wheel. The applied patent disclosed a grit particle
 size of 50-100 microns. Which of the following timely taken courses of action would comply with the
 patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP for overcoming the rejection?
"
"
(A) Argue that the patent teaches away from the use of a diamond grit particle coating on a polishing
 wheel and thus does not teach the claimed invention. 
(B) File a declaration under 37 CFR 1.132 showing unexpected results using diamond grit rather than glass
 grit. 
(C) Antedate the applied patent by filing a declaration under 37 CFR 1.131 showing that applicant invented
 the claimed subject matter prior to the effective date of the applied patent. 
(D) Argue the applied patent is nonanalogous art. 
(E) Amend the claim by adding a limitation that the diamond grit particle size is 5-7 microns, and arguing
 that the claimed invention differs from applied patent by limited the diamond grit particle size to
 5-7 microns.
"
"


(E) is the correct answer. 35 USC § 102(b); 37 CFR § 1.111(b); MPEP §§ 706.02(b), 2131 and 2131.03. As
 stated in MPEP 2131, under the heading ""To Anticipate A Claim, The Reference Must Teach Every Element
 Of The Claim,"" ""A claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is found,
 either expressly or inherently described, in a single prior art reference."" Verdegaal Bros. v. Union
 Oil Co. of California, 814 F.2d 628, 631, 2 USPQ2d 1051, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 1987). MPEP 2131.03, under
 the heading, ""Prior Art Which Teaches A Range Within, Overlapping, Or Touching The Claimed Range Anticipates
 If The Prior Art Range Discloses The Claimed Range With `Sufficient Specificity.' states ""When the prior
 art discloses a range which touches, overlaps or is within the claimed range, but no specific examples
 falling within the claimed range are disclosed, a case by case determination must be made as to anticipation.
 In order to anticipate the claims, the claimed subject matter must be disclosed in the reference with
 `sufficient specificity to constitute an anticipation under the statute.' A claim containing a limitation
 that the grit particle size is 5-7 microns would not be anticipated by the applied reference, because
 the applied reference discloses a different grit particle size well outside that range.

A registered practitioner filed in the USPTO a client's utility patent application on December 30, 2002.
 The application was filed with a request for nonpublication, certifying that the invention disclosed
 in the U.S. application has not and will not be the subject of an application in another country, or
 under a multilateral international agreement, that requires eighteen month publication. Subsequently,
 the client files an application in Japan on the invention and some recent improvements to the invention.
 The improvements are not disclosed or supported in the utility application. Japan is a country that
 requires eighteen month publication. Two months after filing the application in Japan, and before filing
 any other papers in the USPTO, the client remembers that a nonpublication request was filed and informs
 the practitioner about the application that was filed in Japan. Which of the following courses of action
 is in accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP?
"
"
(A) The application is abandoned because the practitioner did not rescind the nonpublication request
 and provide notice of foreign filing within 45 days of having filed the application in Japan. The applicant
 must now file a petition and fee to revive under 37 CFR 1.137(b). 
(B) The application is abandoned because the applicant did not rescind the nonpublication request before
 filing the application in Japan. The applicant must now file a petition and fee to revive under 37 CFR
 1.137(b). 
(C) The applicant should file an amendment to the specification of the U.S. application, adding the recent
 improvements to the disclosure in the specification. 
(D) The application is abandoned because the applicant did not rescind the nonpublication request by
 notifying the Office under 37 CFR 1.213(c) within the appropriate time. The applicant must now file
 a petition and fee to revive under 37 CFR 1.137(b). 
(E) The applicant could today notify the USPTO of the foreign filing. It is not necessary to file a petition
 and fee to revive for the application to continue to be examined in the USPTO.

Which of the following would comply with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP
 and would be a fully responsive reply to a non final Office action on the merits rejecting all the claims
 in the application as being unpatentable under 35 USC 102 and/or 103 over prior art references?
"
"
(A) A timely filed and properly signed written reply which does not include an amendment to the claims,
 but includes a request for the examiner's rejections to be reconsidered supported by arguments replying
 to every ground of rejection and distinctly and specifically points out the supposed errors in every
 rejection. and pointing out the specific distinctions believed to render the claims patentable over
 any applied references. 
(B) A timely filed and properly signed written reply which includes an amendment canceling all the claims
 in the application and adding new claims, and a request for the examiner's rejections to be reconsidered
 in view of the newly presented claims. 
(C) A timely filed and properly signed written reply which does not include an amendment to the claims,
 but does generally alleges that the claims define a patentable invention. 
(D) A timely filed and properly signed written request for continued examination (RCE). 
(E) All of the above.
"
"


(A) is the most correct answer. 37 CFR § 1.111; MPEP § 714.02. Section 1.111 states in pertinent part:
 ""(a)(1) If the Office action after the first examination (§ 1.104) is adverse in any respect, the applicant
 or patent owner, ... must reply and request reconsideration or further examination, with or without
 amendment. ... (b) In order to be entitled to reconsideration or further examination, the applicant
 or patent owner must reply to the Office action. The reply by the applicant or patent owner must be
 reduced to a writing which distinctly and specifically points out the supposed errors in the examiner's
 action and must reply to every ground of objection and rejection in the prior Office action. The reply
 must present arguments pointing out the specific distinctions believed to render the claims, including
 any newly presented claims, patentable over any applied references.... The applicant's or patent owner's
 reply must appear throughout to be a bona fide attempt to advance the application or the reexamination
 proceeding to final action. A general allegation that the claims define a patentable invention without
 specifically pointing out how the language of the claims pate ntably distinguishes them from the references
 does not comply with the requirements of this section."" MPEP § 714.02 states ""In all cases where reply
 to a requirement is indicated as necessary to further consideration of the claims ... a complete reply

A patent application is filed having one claim (claim 1). The most relevant prior art uncovered by the
 primary examiner, after searching the claimed subject matter, is a published abstract summarizing the
 disclosure of a foreign patent document. The abstract is in English, the foreign document is in German.
 Both the published abstract and the foreign document are prior art under 35 USC 102(b). The published
 abstract provides an adequate basis for concluding that claim 1 is prima facie obvious under 35 USC
 103. Which of the following actions is in accord with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related
 in the MPEP?
"
"
(A) Reject claim 1 under 35 USC 103, based on the abstract, because it is a publication in its own right
 and provides sufficient basis for a prima facie case of obviousness. 
(B) Reject claim 1 under 35 USC 103, based on the abstract, because disclosures that are not in English
 cannot form the basis of a prior art rejection. 
(C) Reject claim 1 under 35 USC 103, based on the German-language patent document, as evidenced by the
 abstract. 
(D) Do not reject claim 1 based on the abstract; instead, obtain a translation of the German-language
 document and determine whether its full disclosure supports a rejection under 35 USC 102(b) or 103.
 
(E) Do not reject the claims based on the abstract because an abstract can never provide sufficient disclosure
 to be enabling.
"
"


(A) or (D) is accepted as correct. As to (A), MPEP § 706.02, under the heading “Reliance Upon Abstracts
 And Foreign Language Documents In Support Of A Rejection,” states “[i]n limited circumstances, it may
 be appropriate for the examiner to make a rejection in a non-final Office action based in whole or in
 part on the abstract only without relying on the full text document.” In the facts, the “published abstract
 provides an adequate basis for concluding that claim 1 is prima facie obvious under 35 USC 103.” As
 to (D) MPEP § 706.02, under the heading “Reliance Upon Abstracts And Foreign Language Documents In Support
 Of A Rejection,” states “[c]itation of and reliance upon an abstract without citation of and reliance
 upon the underlying scientific document is generally inappropriate where both the abstract and the underlying
 document are prior art. See Ex parte Jones, 62 USPQ2d 1206, 1208 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 2001) (unpublished).”

A patent application is filed disclosing and claiming a system for detecting expired parking meters.
 The specification fully supports the original, sole claim. The application discloses that the “electronics
 control unit” contains a comparator and an alarm. The application includes several drawings. One of
 the drawings shows a block diagram of the system, illustrating the electronics control unit as a box,
 labeled “electronics control unit.” The sole claim of the application is as follows: 
The claim. A system
 for detecting expired parking meters, comprising: a timer mechanism; an infrared sensor for detecting
 the presence of a parked vehicle; and an electronics control unit, including a comparator and an alarm,
 coupled to the infrared sensor and the timer mechanism. 
A final Office action, dated February 3, 2004,
 indicates that the sole claim contains allowable subject matter, but includes an objection to the specification,
 on the grounds that the subject matter of the electronics control unit, though described in a sufficiently
 specific and detailed manner in the original specification, was required to be shown in the drawings
 under 37 CFR 1.83. The Office action did not set a period for reply. Determine which of the following
 actions, if any, comports with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP for overcoming
 the objection.
"
"
(A) On April 1, 2004, a Notice of Appeal is filed together with appropriate fees, and a brief pointing
 out that a patent should issue since the subject matter of the electronics control unit was adequately
 described in the original specification. 
(B) On April 1, 2004, a drawing is filed in the USPTO illustrating only the comparator and alarm of the
 electronics control unit that was described in the original specification. 
(C) On April 1, 2004, a Notice of Appeal of appeal is filed together with appropriate fees, and a brief
 pointing out that the addition of a drawing showing the electronics control unit would not constitute
 addition of new matter since the electronics control unit was adequately described in the original specification.
 
(D) On September 1, 2004, a petition is filed urging that no further drawing should be required because
 the subject matter of the electronics control unit, for purposes of the application, was adequately
 disclosed in the block diagram drawing. 
(E) None of the above.

(B). 37 CFR § 1.83(a); MPEP §§ 608.01(l) and 706.03(o). MPEP § 608.01(l) states “[w]here subject matter
 not shown in a drawing...is claimed in the specification as filed, and such original claim itself constitutes
 a clear disclosure of this subject matter, then the claim should be treated on its merits, and requirement
 made to amend the drawing and description to show this subject matter...It is the drawing...that [is]
 defective, not the claim. It is, of course, to be understood that this disclosure in the claim must
 be sufficiently specific and detailed to support the necessary amendment of the drawing...” MPEP § 608.02(d)
 and 706.03(o). MPEP § 706.03(o), state “[i]f subject matter capable of illustration is originally claimed

Applicant files a patent application in Japan on January 5, 2000. Applicant files a PCT international
 application designating the United States on January 5, 2001, based on the Japanese application. The
 international application is published in English on July 5, 2001. The international application enters
 the national stage in the United States on September 5, 2001. The USPTO publishes the application on
 June 6, 2002. The application issues as a United States patent on December 3, 2002. What is its earliest
 possible 35 USC 102(e) prior art date for the application published by the United States, in view of
 the amendment to Title 35 by the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 and the Intellectual Property

(C) July 5, 2001. 
(D) June 6, 2002. 
(E) December 3, 2002.

"


Answer (B) is the most correct answer. 35 USC § 102(e)(1) provides that a US published application of
 a national stage of an international application filed on or after November 29, 2000 has a prior art
 effect as of its international filing date, if the international application designated the United States,
 and was published in English. Because in the above fact pattern, the international application designated
 the United States and was published in English, and was filed on or after November 29, 2000, the USPTO
 published application is entitled to its international filing date of January 5, 2001 for prior art
 purposes under 35 USC § 102(e)(1). See Example 4 of MPEP § 706.02(f)(1).

(A) and (D) are accepted as the correct answers. Regarding answer (A), see 35 USC § 122(b)(2)(B)(iii);
 37 CFR § 1.213; MPEP § 901.03 for information on nonpublication requests. See 37 CFR § 1.137(f); MPEP
 § 711.03(c), under the heading “3. Abandonment for Failure to Notify the Office of a Foreign Filing
 After Submission of a Non-Publication Request.” (D) was also accepted because the statement characterizes
 the status of the application as being abandoned, though the application has not necessarily attained
 abandoned status. The course of action postulated in (D) is a proper reply if the application was abandoned.
 Accordingly, (D) was accepted as a correct answer under these circumstances.

In accordance with USPTO rules and procedures set forth in the MPEP, which of the following is not a
 proper basis on which the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences may remand a case to the examiner?
"
"
(A) Remand for a fuller description of the claimed invention. 
(B) Remand for a clearer explanation of the pertinence of the references. 
(C) Remand for a selection by the primary examiner of a preferred or best ground of rejection when multiple
 rejections of a cumulative nature have been made by the examiner. 
(D) Remand to the primary examiner with instructions to consider an affidavit not entered by the examiner
 which was filed after the final rejection but before the appeal. 
(E) Remand to the primary examiner to prepare a supplemental examiner's answer in response to a reply
 brief.
"
"


(D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 1211.02. (D) is not a proper basis for remand because the
 Board has no authority to require the examiner to consider an affidavit which has not been entered after
 final rejection and which was filed while the application was pending before the examiner. Pursuant
 to 37 CFR § 1.195, ""[a]ffidavits... submitted after the case has been appealed will not be admitted
 without a showing of good and sufficient reasons why they were not earlier presented."" The facts are
 silent regarding whether such a showing was made. However, as discussed in MPEP § 715.09, ""Review of
 an examiner's refusal to enter [and consider] an affidavit as untimely is by petition and not by appeal
 to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences. In re Deters, 515 F.2d 1152, 185 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1975);

(A) Persuasively arguing that the claims are patentably distinguishable from the prior art. 
(B) Filing an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.132 showing that the reference invention is not
 by “another.” 
(C) Filing an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.131 showing prior invention, if the reference is
 not a U.S. patent that either claims the same invention or claims an obvious variation of the subject
 matter in the rejected claim(s). 
(D) (A) and (C). 
(E) (A), (B) and (C).

The Office mailed an Office action containing a proper final rejection dated July 8, 2002. The Office
 action did not set a period for reply. On January 7, 2003, in reply to the final rejection, a registered
 practitioner filed a request for continued examination under 37 CFR 1.114, a request for a suspension
 of action under 37 CFR 1.103(c) to suspend action for three months, and proper payment all required
 fees. No submission in reply to the outstanding Office action accompanied the request for continued
 examination. No other paper was submitted and no communication with the Office was held until after
 Midnight, January 8, 2003. Which of the following statements accords with the USPTO rules and the procedures
 set forth in the MPEP?
"
"
(A) If an appropriate reply is submitted within the three month period of suspension permitted under
 37 CFR 1.103(c), the application will not be held abandoned. 
(B) The application will not be held abandoned if an appropriate reply is submitted within the three
 month period of suspension and it is accompanied by a showing that the reply could not have been submitted
 within the period set in the final rejection. For example, the reply includes a showing based on an
 experiment that required 8 months to conduct. 
(C) No reply will prevent the application from being held abandoned. 
(D) If, on January 10, 2003, the primary examiner and applicant agree to an examiner’s amendment that
 places the application in condition for allowance and a notice of allowance is mailed within the three
 month period of suspension, application X will not be held abandoned. 
(E) No other submission by applicant is necessary because application X is still pending. The examiner
 is required to act on the request for continued examination after expiration of the three month period
 of suspension.
"
"


(C) is the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 709, under the heading “Request By The Applicant,”
 subheading “Request for Suspension Under 37 CFR 1.103(b) or (c),” “The Office will not grant the requested
 suspension of action unless the following requirements are met: (A) the request must be filed with the
 filing of a CPA or an RCE...(1) if the request is filed with an RCE, the RCE must be in compliance with
 37 CFR 1.114, i.e., the RCE must be accompanied by a submission and the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e).
 Note that the payment of the RCE filing fee may not be deferred and the request for suspension cannot
 substitute for the submission.” The RCE was improper because no submission in reply to the outstanding
 Office action accompanied the RCE. Since the RCE was improper, the Office will not recognize the request
 for suspension. The time period set in the final rejection continues to run from the mail date of the
 Office action. Since the Office action did not set a period for reply, applicant has a maximum period
 of six months for reply. A reply was due on February 8, 2003. Since the RCE was improper and the Office
 did not recognize the request for suspension, the application became abandoned at Midnight of February
 8, 2003.

In 1995 Patent Agent filed a U.S. patent application containing five claims (Application 1). All five
 claims are fully supported under 35 U.S.C. § 112 by the disclosure of Application 1. In 2000, Patent
 Agent filed a U.S. patent application (Application 2) that was a continuation- in-part of Application
 1. Application 2 adds new subject matter to the disclosure of Application 1, and ten additional claims.
 Of the fifteen claims in Application 2, claims 1-5 are exactly the same as Application 1, claims 6-10
 are fully supported under 35 U.S.C. § 112 by the disclosure of Application 1, and claims 11- 15 are

You have just received an Office action rejecting all of your claims in your patent application as anticipated
 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) using published declassified material as the reference. The examiner explains
 that the declassified material is being used as prima facie evidence of prior knowledge as of the printing
 date. The published declassified material contains information showing that it was printed six months
 before the filing date of the application, and that it was published two months after the application’s
 filing date. You correctly note that although the printing date precedes your application filing date
 by six months, you note that the publication was classified as of its printing date (thus, available
 only for limited distribution even when the application was filed), and was not declassified until its
 publication date (when it became available to the general public). Each element of the claimed invention
 is described in the publication of the declassified material. Which of the following statements is true?
"
"
(A) The rejection is not supported by the reference. 
(B) The publication is not available as a reference because it did not become available to the general
 public until after the filing date of your patent application. 
(C) The publication is prima facie evidence of prior knowledge even though it was available only for
 limited distribution as of its printing date. 
(D) The publication constitutes an absolute statutory bar. 
(E) It is not possible to use a Rule 131 affidavit or declaration to antedate the printing date of the
 publication.

 the original foreign application. 
(C) Applicant’s statement in a declaration under 37 C.F.R. § 1.132 that although the invention as claimed
 had been offered for sale in department stores in New York during 1997, this was done only to analyze
 consumer acceptance of the packaging in which the invention is marketed. 
(D) A journal article, published May 1, 1997, disclosing all the elements of the claim and teaching how

Mario Lepieux was a member of a Canadian national hockey team touring Europe. While traveling through
 Germany (a WTO member country) in December 1998, Mario conceived of an aerodynamic design for a hockey
 helmet that offered players improved protection while reducing air resistance during skating. Upon Mario’s
 return to Canada (a NAFTA country), he enlisted his brothers Luigi and Pepe Lepieux to help him market
 the product under the tradename “Wing Cap.” On February 1, 1999, without Mario’s knowledge or permission,
 Luigi anonymously published a promotional article written by Mario and fully disclosing how the Wing
 Cap was made and used. The promotional article was published in Moose Jaw Monthly, a regional Canadian
 magazine that is not distributed in the United States. The Wing Cap was first reduced to practice on
 March 17, 1999. A United States patent application properly naming Mario as the sole inventor was filed
 September 17, 1999. That application has now been rejected as being anticipated by the Moose Jaw Monthly
 article. Which of the following statements is most correct?
"
"
(A) The promotional article cannot be used as prior art because the Wing Cap had not been reduced to
 practice at the time the article appeared in the regional Canadian magazine. 
(B) The regional Canadian magazine article is not prima facie prior art because it was published without
 Mario’s knowledge or permission. 
(C) The regional Canadian magazine article is not prima facie prior art because it appeared in a regional
 Canadian publication and does not evidence knowledge or use in the United States. 
(D) The promotional article in the regional Canadian magazine constituted an offer to sell that operates
 as an absolute bar against Mario’s patent application. 
(E) Mario, as the inventor, can overcome the rejection by filing an affidavit under 37 C.F.R. § 1.132
 establishing that he is the inventor, and the article describes his work.
"

The correct answer is (E). MPEP § 716.10. There is no requirement that a publication describe something
 that has actually been reduced to practice before the publication can act as a prior art reference.

A registered practitioner filed in the USPTO a client’s utility patent application on December 30, 2002.
 The application was filed with a request for nonpublication, certifying that the invention disclosed
 in the U.S. application has not and will not be the subject of an application in another country, or
 under a multilateral international agreement, that requires eighteen month publication. Subsequently,
 the client files an application in Japan on the invention and some recent improvements to the invention.
 The improvements are not disclosed or supported in the utility application. Japan is a country that
 requires eighteen month publication. Two months after filing the application in Japan, and before filing
 any other papers in the USPTO, the client remembers that a nonpublication request was filed and informs
 the practitioner about the application that was filed in Japan. Which of the following courses of action
 is in accordance with the USPTO rules and the procedures set forth in the MPEP?
"
"
(A) The application is abandoned because the practitioner did not rescind the nonpublication request
 and provide notice of foreign filing within 45 days of having filed the application in Japan. The applicant
 must now file a petition and fee to revive under 37 CFR 1.137(b). 
(B) The application is abandoned because the applicant did not rescind the nonpublication request before
 filing the application in Japan. The applicant must now file a petition and fee to revive under 37 CFR
 1.137(b). 
(C) The applicant should file an amendment to the specification of the U.S. application, adding the recent
 improvements to the disclosure in the specification. 
(D) The application is abandoned because the applicant did not rescind the nonpublication request by
 notifying the Office under 37 CFR 1.213(c) within the appropriate time. The applicant must now file
 a petition and fee to revive under 37 CFR 1.137(b).

 shortened statutory period for reply and the Office does not mail an advisory action until after the
 end of the 3-month shortened statutory period, the period for reply for purposes of determining the
 amount of any extension fee will be the date on which the Office mails the Advisory Action advising
 applicant of the status of the application...” Hence, since no extension fee was paid in the fact pattern,
 the time allowed applicant for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken is the mail date
 of the Advisory Action, i.e., May 31, 2000. 37 CFR § 1.192(a) recites, in pertinent part, “Appellant
 must, within two months from the date of the notice of appeal under § 1.191 or within the time allowed
 for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken, if such time is later, file a brief in triplicate.”

Mark Twine obtains a patent directed to a machine for manufacturing string. The patent contains a single
 claim (Claim 1) which recites six claim elements. The entire interest in Twine’s patent is assigned
 to the S. Clemens String Co., and Twine is available and willing to cooperate with S. Clemens String
 Co. to file a reissue application. A subsequent reissue application includes Claim 2, which is similar
 to original Claim 1. However, one of the elements recited in Claim 2 is broader than its counterpart
 element in the original claim. The remaining five elements are narrower than their respective counterpart
 elements in the original patent claim. 
Which of the following scenarios accords with the USPTO rules
 and the procedures set forth in the MPEP?
"
"
(A) The S. Clemens String Co. files the reissue application more than 2 years after the issue date of
 the original patent application. 
(B) The S. Clemens String Co. files the reissue application less than 2 years after the issue date of
 the original patent but more than 2 years after original application filing date. 
(C) Mark Twine files the reissue application less than 2 years after the issue date of the original patent

Inventor Joe is anxious to get a patent with the broadest claim coverage possible for the invention.
 Joe retained a registered practitioner, Jane, to obtain the advantage of legal counsel in obtaining
 broad protection. Jane filed a patent application for the invention. The inventor heard that, although
 patent prosecution is conducted in writing, it is possible to get interviews with examiners. Joe believes
 an interview might hasten the grant of a patent by providing the examiner a better understanding of
 the true novelty of the invention. Which of the following are consistent with the USPTO rules and the
 procedures set forth in the MPEP regarding usage of interviews?
"
"
(A) Prior to the first Office action being mailed the inventor calls the examiner to whom the application
 is docketed to offer help in understanding the specification. 
(B) After receiving the first Office action Jane calls the examiner for an interview for the purpose
 of clarifying the structure and operation of the invention as claimed and disclosed, because the examiner’s
 analysis regarding patentability in the rejection is novel and suggests that the examiner is interpreting
 the claimed invention in a manner very different from the inventor’s intent. 
(C) Jane has Larry, a registered practitioner in the Washington D.C. area, who is more familiar with
 interview practice to call the examiner. Jane gives Larry a copy of the first Office action, which suggests
 that the primary examiner’s analysis is incorrect, and offers to explain why. Jane instructs Larry that
 because Larry is unfamiliar with the inventor, Larry should not agree to possible ways in which the
 claims could be modified, or at least indicate to the examiner that Jane would have to approve of any
 such agreement. 
(D) Jane calls the primary examiner after receiving the final rejection, demanding that the examiner
 withdraw the finality of the final action. When the examiner states that the final rejection is proper,
 Jane demands an interview as a matter of right to explain the arguments. 
(E) (B) and (D).
"
"


(B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 713.01. An interview should be had only when the nature of
 the case is such that the interview could serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a
 mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant, and thereby advance the prosecution of
 the application.

Application A was filed after November 29, 2000. Reference X and application A were commonly owned at
 the time the invention of application A was made. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures
 as related in the MPEP the prior art exclusion of 35 USC 103(c) can be properly invoked to obviate which
 of the following rejections?
"
"
(A) A rejection under 35 USC 102(e) based on reference X, if reference X is prior art only under 35 USC
 102(e). 
(B) A double patenting rejection based on reference X, if reference X is available as prior art only

The correct answer is (C). See MPEP § 706.02(l) et seq. In accordance with proper USPTO policy and procedure,
 the prior art exclusion of 35 USC § 103(c) can only be invoked when the reference only qualifies as
 prior art under 35 USC § 102(f), 35 USC § 102(g), or 35 USC 102(e) for applications filed on or after
 November 29, 1999, the application and the reference were commonly owned, or subject to an assignment

Co-inventors Smith and Jones filed an application for a patent on a cell phone, on May 15, 2002. They
 received a first Office action from a primary examiner rejecting the claims under 35 USC 102(a) over
 a publication by Bell and Watson, published on April 5, 2002, describing a cell phone having all the
 same features as is claimed in the patent application. In reply, the co-inventors each submitted a declaration
 under 37 CFR 1.131 stating that they had actually reduced the invention to practice no later than March
 13, 2002. However, the declarations failed to include two claimed features. Neither the particular antenna
 needed to enable the cell phone could receive transmissions from the local cellular transmitting tower,
 nor a detachable carrying strap was included in the declarations. As evidence of their prior reduction
 to practice, Smith and Jones submitted their co-authored journal article. The journal article contained
 a figure of the cell phone as described in the declarations. That is, the cell phone shown in the figure
 of the article lacked an antenna and a detachable strap. The article was received by the journal on
 March 13, 2002, and was published on April 30, 2002. The cell phones shown in the figure in the Bell
 and Watson publication, and in the Smith and Jones patent application have the particular antenna and
 a detachable strap. Which of the following actions, if taken by the examiner, would be the most proper
 in accordance with the patent laws, rules and the procedures as related in the MPEP?
"
"
(A) The examiner should maintain the rejection of the claims under 35 USC 102(a) and make the rejection
 final. 
(B) The examiner should withdraw the rejection and look for references which have a publication date
 prior to May 15, 2001. 
(C) The examiner should withdraw the rejection and notify Smith and Jones that their application is in
 condition for allowance. 
(D) The examiner should maintain the rejection, but indicate that the claims would be allowable if Smith
 and Jones provided an original copy of the figure published in their journal article as factual support
 for their declarations. 
(E) The examiner should maintain the rejection and inform Smith and Jones that the declarations are insufficient
 because they cannot “swear behind” a reference which is a statutory bar.
"
"


(A) is the correct answer. MPEP § 715.07, under the heading “Facts and Documentary Evidence” states that
 “The essential thing to be shown under 37 CFR 1.131 is priority of invention and this may be done by
 any satisfactory evidence of the fact. FACTS, not conclusions, must be alleged. Evidence in the form
 of exhibits may accompany the affidavit or declaration. ... The affidavit or declaration must state
 FACTS and produce such documentary evidence and exhibits in support thereof as are available to show
 conception and completion of invention in this country or in a NAFTA or WTO member country (MPEP § 715.07(c))
 at least the conception being at a date prior to the effective date of the reference. ... In general,
 proof of actual reduction to practice requires a showing that the apparatus actually existed and worked
 for its intended purpose.” Here, the co-inventors admit, and the documentary exhibits relied upon demonstrate
 that they failed to reduce the claimed invention to practice prior to the publication date of the Bell
 and Watson reference. It is also apparent that due to the lack of an antenna in the cell phone described
 in Smith’s and Jones’s declarations and journal article, that the cell phone which was reduced to practice
 prior to the publication date of the Bell and Watson article would not have worked for its intended
 purpose. Accordingly, the examiner should maintain the rejection and make it final.

Answer: After Notice of Allowance in reissue application. MPEP 714.16. With the exception of a supplemental
 oath or declaration submitted in a reissue, a supplemental oath or declaration is not treated as an
 amendment under 37 CFR 1.312. See MPEP § 603.01. A supplemental reissue oath or declaration is treated
 as an amendment under 37 CFR 1.312 because the correction of the patent which it provides is an amendment

What happens to the trade secret information in reexam if the Examiner finds it material to the patentability
 of the invention, and what if there is/or isn't a request to expunge the information?
"
"
nan
"
"


MPEP 724. That wherever possible, trade secret law and patent laws should be administered in such manner
 that the former will not deter an inventor from seeking the benefit of the latter, because, the public
 is most benefited by the early disclosure of the invention in consideration of the patent grant. If
 a patent applicant is unwilling to pursue his right to a patent at the risk of certain loss of trade
 secret protection, the two systems will conflict, the public will be deprived of knowledge of the invention
 in many cases, and inventors will be reluctant to bring unsettled legal questions of significant current
 interest . . . for resolution. 
MPEP 724.04. Any materials submitted under MPEP § 724.02 in a reexamination
 file open to the public under 37 CFR 1.11(d) will be treated in the following manner: (A) >Materials
 submitted under MPEP § 724.02 will only be released to the public with any other papers in the reexamination
 file if no petition to expunge (37 CFR 1.59) was filed prior to the mailing of a Notice of Intent to
 Issue Reexamination Certificate (NIRC), or if a petition to expunge was filed and the petition was denied.<
 The submitted information will be maintained separate from the reexamination file and will not be publicly
 available until a determination has been made as to whether or not the information is important to a
 reasonable examiner in deciding whether or not a claim is patentable. (B) >Prior to the mailing of a
 NIRC, the examiner will review the reexamination file and determine if a petition to expunge is in the
 reexamination file but not acted upon.< The examiner, or other appropriate Office official who is responsible
 for considering the information, will make a determination as to whether or not any portion or all of
 the information submitted is important to a reasonable examiner in deciding whether or not a claim is
 patentable. (C) If any portion or all of the submitted information is found important to a reasonable
 examiner in deciding whether or not a claim is patentable, **>the petition to expunge will be denied
 and the information< will thereafter become a permanent part of the reexamination file and open to the
 public. (D) If any portion or all of the submitted information is found not to be important to a reasonable
 examiner in deciding whether or not a claim is patentable,>the petition to expunge will be granted and
 the information expunged.< (E) >If a petition to expunge is not filed prior to the mailing of the NIRC,

When is a supplemental oath or declaration treated as an amendment?

"


MPEP 714.16. With the exception of a supplemental oath or declaration submitted in a reissue, a supplemental
 oath or declaration is not treated as an amendment under 37 CFR 1.312. See MPEP § 603.01. A supplemental
 reissue oath or declaration is treated as an amendment under 37 CFR 1.312 because the correction of
 the patent which it provides is an amendment of the patent, even though no amendment is physically entered
 into the specification or claim(s). Thus, for a reissue oath or declaration submitted after allowance
 to be entered, the reissue applicant must comply with 37 CFR 1.312 in the manner set forth in this section.

Your Japanese client, Z, came to you on August 11, 2010 with a valuable 
invention for pulping timber.
 Z informed you it had been successfully using the invention commercially for the past fourteen months
 deep in the Japanese forests. The invention has not been used anywhere else by Z, and the pulped timber
 from the Z operations has not left Japan. At least one competitor, another Japanese company, lawfully
 observed the invention in operation during its first month of use with no restriction as to confidentiality
 or disclosure. Z filed a Japanese patent application prior to commercial use of the invention, but (in
 an effort to hold down expenses) chose not file a corresponding application in the United States. The
 Japanese patent application remains pending. Z just learned that two months ago its competitor began
 using the invention commercially in the United States. The invention was never disclosed or used in
 the United States prior to two months ago. Z would like for you seek a United States patent on the invention
 to block the competitor from continued use of the invention. Which of the following would be reasonable
 advice from you to Z?
"
"
(A) Since Japan is a NAFTA country, Z is precluded from getting a United States patent because the Japanese
 application was filed more than twelve months ago and the invention was in public use more than one
 year prior to any possible United States filing date for an Z patent application. 
(B) Z should promptly file an application in the United States claiming the benefit of the filing date
 of the Japanese application and should fully disclose the Japanese commercial activities, the observation
 of the invention in Japan by Z's competitor, and the competitor's commercial activities in the United
 States. 
(C) Z should promptly file an application in the United States without claiming the benefit of the filing
 date of the Japanese application and should fully disclose the Japanese commercial activities, the observation
 of the invention in Japan by Z's competitor, and the competitor's commercial activities in the United
 States. 
(D) Z should abandon the pending Japanese application to avoid the possibility the Japanese application
 could be used as prior art against a United States patent application, and then file a patent application
 in the United States. 
(E) Since Z's activities concerning the invention all took place in Japan, the competitor's commercial
 use in the United States prior to any possible United States filing date for an Z patent application
 precludes Z from obtaining a United States patent.
"
"


ANSWER: The best answer is (C). With regard to Statement (A), public use in Japan is not a statutory
 bar under 35 USC § 102(b) regardless of whether Japan is a NAFTA country. MPEP § 706.02(c). Thus, although
 Z cannot claim priority to the Japanese application under 35 USC § 119, their commercial activity is
 not a bar. Statement (B) is incorrect because Z cannot rely on the Japanese application for priority.
 35 U. S.C. § 119. Under the given facts, the Japanese application would not be prior art against a U.S.
 application regardless of whether the Japanese application was abandoned. Thus, (D) is not reasonable
 advice. Under 35 USC § 104, Z can rely on Japanese activities to establish a date of invention prior
 to the competitor's commercial use in the United States. Statement (E) is therefore not reasonable advice.

In early 2007, X, a company based in Canada, developed a widget with increased reflective properties.
 X filed a patent application in the Canadian Patent Office on January 8, 2007, and filed a corresponding
 application in the USPTO on January 5, 2008. All research activities for the inventions disclosed and
 claimed in the U.S. and Canadian applications took place in Canada. The U.S. patent application contains
 five claims: 
1. A widget comprising elements A and B. 2. A widget according to Claim I wherein the
 widget further includes element D. 3. A widget comprising elements A and C. 4. A widget according to
 Claim 3 wherein the widget further includes element E. 5. A widget comprising elements A, B, and C.
 
The Canadian application only supports claims 1, 2, and 5 of the U.S. application. During the course

 to overcome the reference in accordance with proper pre-AIA USPTO practice and procedure?
"
"
(A) In a 37 CFR 1.131 affidavit or declaration, it is sufficient to allege that applicant or patent owner
 has been diligent. 
(B) In a 37 CFR 1.131 affidavit or declaration, it is sufficient to clearly establish conception of the
 invention prior to the effective date of the reference, and diligence from just prior to the effective
 date of the reference to actual reduction to practice. The presence of a lapse of time between the reduction
 to practice of an invention and the filing of an application thereon is not relevant. 
(C) In a 37 CFR 1.131 affidavit or declaration it is sufficient to clearly establish conception of the
 invention prior to the effective date of the reference. Diligence need not be considered. 
(D) In a 37 CFR 1.131 affidavit or declaration, it is sufficient to show conception and reduction to

X discovered that a silver insert for a metal cutting tool may be bonded (with a far superior bond strength
 over other known methods of attachment) to a steel tool holder. X filed a patent application on his
 invention which contained the following two claims: 
(1) A method of bonding a silver insert to a steel
 tool holder comprising the steps of 
providing a layer of polystick at the interface of the holder and
 insert, heating the holder, insert and polystick to a temperature of 250°F. and thereafter cooling the
 holder, insert, and polystick at a rate of between 12° and 13°F. per hour until a temperature of 120°F.
 is reached. (2) A silver insert bonded to a steel holder by the method of claim 1. 
The examiner rejected
 Claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over a U.S. patent to Y in view of a British patent
 to Z. The examiner rejected Claim 2 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as being anticipated by the patent to Y.
 The patent to Y teaches that a silver insert is bonded to a steel tool holder by utilizing a layer of
 polystick at the interface of the insert and holder, but makes no mention of any particular temperatures.
 The patent to Z teaches that in a grinding tool, diamond chips may be ""securely fastened"" to a ceramic
 holder by applying a layer of polystick at the interface of the diamonds and holder, heating the holder,
 chips, and polystick to a temperature of 150°F. and thereafter ""slowly"" cooling the holder. Which of
 the following, if any, if submitted with a reply to the Office action, would be most persuasive and
 most likely overcome the examiner's rejection of Claim 2?
"
"
(A) Evidence that a gear-cutting Chine which includes a silver insert bonded to a steel tool holder as
 set forth in Claim 1 is outselling all other such Chines by a two-to-one margin. 
(B) An affidavit by X that, in his opinion, the patent to Z is inoperative. 
(C) Evidence that heavy advertising resulted in increased sales of X's invention. 
(D) An affidavit by X showing that there is a long felt need in the industry for X's silver insert to
 a steel tool holder. 
(E) None of the above.
"
"


ANSWER: (E) is the correct answer. MPEP §§ 2131.04; 706.02(b). Claim 2 was rejected as being anticipated
 by the patent to Y. As set forth in MPEP § 706.02(b), a rejection based on 35 USC § 102(b) can be overcome
 by ""(A) Persuasively arguing that the claims are patentably distinguishable from the prior art; or (B)
 Amending the claims to patentably distinguish over the prior art."" Evidence of secondary considerations
 is irrelevant to § 102 rejections and thus cannot overcome a rejection so based. MPEP § 2131.04, citing

 patent examiner set a three month shortened statutory period for reply. The applicant petitioned for
 a one- month extension of time on Monday, June 18, 2001 and paid the appropriate one- month extension
 fee. An Amendment responsive to the Office action was filed Tuesday, July 17, 2001. In the Remarks portion
 of the Amendment, the applicant stated: ""It is believed that no fees are required by the present Amendment.
 However, if any fees are necessary, including fees for any required extension of time, the Director
 of the United States Patent and Trademark Office is hereby authorized to charge any such fees to applicant's
 deposit account number nn- nnnn. A duplicate copy of this paper is enclosed."" No fees were submitted
 with the Amendment. Assuming nn- nnnn is a valid deposit account with sufficient funds deposited, which
 of the following statements is true?

"
(A) The Amendment should not be entered because it is untimely. 
(B) The Amendment should be entered with no fees charged to applicant's deposit account. 
(C) The Amendment should be entered, but the fee for a second month extension of time should be charged

(D) The request to charge any required fees, including fees for any necessary extension of time, is ineffective

The most correct answer is (C). The petition for extension of time filed June 18, 2001 provided applicant
 with a one- month extension of time from the original due date, June 16, 2001 (not from the date the
 petition was filed). See MPEP § 710.01(a). Thus, the extended due date was Monday, July 16. Since an
 additional extension of time is needed, (B) is incorrect. Under the provisions of 37 CFR 1.136(a)(3),
 applicant's statement is treated as a constructive petition for extension of time. MPEP § 710.02(e).
 (A) is incorrect because applicant's statement in the Remarks portion of the Amendment acted as a constructive
 petition for extension of time and, therefore, the Amendment is timely. There is no need for the petition
 to appear in a separate paper, so (D) is not correct. (E) is incorrect because (A) and (D) are both

(E) less than one year prior to the presentation of claims to that invention in the application being
 examined, applicant's remedy, if any, is by way of affidavit or declaration traversing the ground of

(A) is the most correct answer, while (D) is not the most correct answer. See MPEP § 715.05, which ,
 in pertinent part, states: When the reference in question is a noncommonly owned U.S. patent claiming
 the same invention as applicant and its issue date is less than 1 year prior to the presentation of
 claims to that invention in the application being examined, applicant's remedy, if any, must be by way
 of 37 CFR § 1.608 instead of 37 CFR § 1.131... . The reference patent can then be overcome only by way
 of interference. (B) and (C) are not the most correct answers. See MPEP § 715.05, which, in pertinent
 part, states: If the patent is claiming the same invention as the application and its issue date is
 1 year or more prior to the presentation of claims to that invention in the application, a rejection

 not limited to inter partes interference proceedings, but may be used as a basis for ex parte rejections.).

 as follows: ""X is a member selected from the group consisting of elements A, B, and C."" The claim is
 properly rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as being anticipated by a reference describing the
 same composition invention wherein X is element A. The rejection may be properly overcome by:
"
"
(A) Amending the claim by canceling elements B and C because the reference is concerned only with element
 A. 
(B) Arguing that the reference is not relevant because it lacks elements B and C. 
(C) Amending the claim by canceling element A from the Markus group. 
(D) Amending the claim by changing ""consisting of"" to ""consisting essentially of."" 
(E) Amending the claim to redefine X as ""being a member selected from the group comprising elements A,
 B, and C.""
"
"


ANSWER: (C). 35 USC 102(b); and MPEP §§ 715.03, 2111.03, and 2173.05(h). Deletion of the anticipated
 element from the claim leaves an invention, which is no longer anticipated by the reference. (A), (D),
 and (E) are incorrect because despite the amendments, the claim remains anticipated since the claim
 is still directed to the invention described in the reference wherein X is element A. For example, in
 (D) and (E), element A would still be a member of the group and the claim would still be anticipated
 by the prior art. (B) is incorrect because the argument does not change the fact that the claim remains
 anticipated by the same invention described in the reference wherein X is element A. (E) is incorrect

(D) File a request for reconsideration today, stating only that ""[t]he rejection is in error because
 the claims define a patentable invention."" 
(E) File a request for reconsideration today, and state that a supplemental amendment will be forthcoming.
"

ANSWER: (A). 37 CFR § 1. III; MPEP § 714.02. (B) is incorrect because the fee must be paid when the request
 for extension of time is made. 37 CFR § 1.136(A); MPEP 710.02(E). (C) is incorrect. The client did not
 give instructions to file the amendment today. Further, an amendment canceling all claims is non-responsive
 to the non-formal rejection. As stated in 37 CFR § 1. III (B), ""In order to be entitled to reconsideration..,
 the applicant ... must reply to the Office action. The reply ... must be reduced to a writing which
 distinctly and specifically points out the supposed errors in the examiner's action and must reply to
 every ground of objection and rejection in the prior Office action."" MPEP § 714.19, item (H). (D) is
 incorrect. ""A general allegation that the claims define a patentable invention without specifically
 pointing out how the language of the claims patentably distinguishes them from the references does not
 comply with the requirements of this section."" 37 CFR § 1. I I I (B). (E) is incorrect inasmuch as it
 does not comply with 37 CFR § 1. I I I (B).

Inventor Jones retained registered practitioner P to Prepare and file a patent application claiming Jones'
 invention. P prepared and filed the application together with a declaration wherein Jones appointed
 P to represent him and conduct all business before the PTO. While P was away on a vacation, Jones filed
 a preliminary amendment in the application amending the claims, and no Office action on the merits was
 issued by the PTO examiner. The amendment was signed by Jones, but not P. When P returned from vacation,
 Jones provided P with a copy of the amendment. Upon review of the amendment, P realized that the scope
 of the claims had been broadened, that the broadened claims are supported by the original disclosure,
 and that the claims now read upon prior art which Jones disclosed to P, but which was not disclosed
 in the specification. The prior art reference is not material to the patentability of the original claims
 in the application. Which of the following actions of P accords with proper PTO practice and procedure
 and is the most likely to place the application in condition for allowance?
"
"
(A) File a supplemental amendment arguing that the Jones amendment should not be entered on the ground
 that 7 CFR § 1.33 provides that ""Double correspondence with an applicant and his attorney or agent.
 . . will not be undertaken."" 
(B) File a supplemental amendment canceling all amendatory changes effected by the Jones amendment. 
(C)
 File a supplemental amendment which (1) cancels all the claims in the patent application, (2) adds the
 original claims, and (3) argues that the newly added claims are supported by the disclosure. 
(D) File a supplemental amendment which (1) adds the original claims, (2) cites to the examiner the prior
 art reference disclosed by Jones to P with an explanation of how the newly added claims patentably distinguish
 over such prior art reference, and argues that the added claims are supported by the disclosure. 
(E) File a supplemental amendment which (1) adds the original claims, (2) cites to the examiner the prior
 art reference disclosed by Jones to P with an explanation of how all the claims in the application patentably
 distinguish over such prior reference, and (3) argues that all the claims in the application are supported
 by the disclosure.

ANSWER: (C). 37 CFR § 1.56; MPEP 2001.04. ""There is no duty to submit information which is not material
 to the patentability of any existing claim."" (A) is wrong because the amendment will be entered per
 MPEP 714.01(d). (B) is wrong because the amendment does not comply with 37 CFR §§ 1.119, 1.121, and
 1.124, and could not be entered. As stated in 37 CFR § 1.124, ""when an amendatory clause is to be amended,
 it should be wholly rewritten and the original insertion canceled, so that no interlineations or deletions
 shall appear in the clause as finally presented. Matter canceled by amendment can be reinstated only
 by a subsequent amendment presenting the canceled matter as a new insertion."" See also MPEP 714.24.
 (D) and (E) do not place the application in condition for allowance because the claims submitted by
 Jones, which read upon the prior art disclosed by Jones to P, are still contained in the application.
