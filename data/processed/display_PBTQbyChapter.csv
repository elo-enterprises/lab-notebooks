Claim 1 of an application recites “[a]n article comprising: (a) a copper substrate; and (b) a electrically
 insulating layer on said substrate.” The specification defines the term “copper” as being elemental
 copper or copper alloys. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the
 MPEP, for purposes of searching and examining the claim, the examiner should interpret the term “copper”
 in the claim as reading on:
"
"
(A) Elemental copper only, based on the plain meaning of “copper.” 
(B) Copper alloys only, based on the special definition in the specification. 
(C) Elemental copper and copper alloys, based on the special definition in the specification. 
(D) Any material that contains copper, including copper compounds. 
(E) None of the above.
"
"


Answer: (C) is the most correct answer. When the specification expressly provides a special definition
 for a term used in the claims, the term must be given that special meaning. See MPEP § 2111.01.

In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which of the following
 does not constitute prior art upon which a primary examiner could properly rely upon in making an obviousness
 rejection under 35 USC 103?
"
"
(A) A U.S. patent in the applicant’s field of endeavor which was issued two years before the filing date
 of applicant’s patent application. 
(B) A non-patent printed publication in a field unrelated to the applicant’s field of endeavor but relevant
 to the particular problem with which the inventor-applicant was concerned, which was published the day
 after the filing date of applicant’s application. 
(C) A printed publication published more than 1 year before the filing date of applicant’s patent application,
 which publication comes from a field outside the applicant’s field of endeavor but concerns the same
 problem with which the applicant-inventor was concerned. 
(D) A printed publication in the applicant’s field of endeavor published 3 years before the filing date
 of applicant’s patent application. 
(E) A U.S. patent which issued more than 1 year before the filing date of applicant’s patent application,
 which the Office placed in a different class than the applicant’s patent application, but which concerns
 the same problem with which the applicant-inventor was concerned, and which shows the same structure
 and function as in the applicant’s patent application.

(B) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2141.01. Quoting from Panduit Corp. v. Dennison Mfg. Co., 810
 F.2d 1561, 1568, 1 USPQ2d 1593, 1597 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1052 (1987), MPEP 2141.01,
 under the heading “Prior Art Available Under 35 USC 102 Is Available Under 35 USC 103,” states “‘[b]efore
 answering Graham's 'content' inquiry, it must be known whether a patent or publication is in the prior
 art under 35 USC § 102.’ Subject matter that is prior art under 35 USC § 102 can be used to support
 a rejection under section 103. Ex parte Andresen, 212 USPQ 100, 102 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1981) (‘it
 appears to us that the commentator [of 35 USCA.] and the [congressional] committee viewed section 103
 as including all of the various bars to a patent as set forth in section 102.’).” Because the printed
 publication in (B) was not published until after the filing date of the patent application, it does
 not constitute prior art.

On January 2, 2001, a registered practitioner filed a patent application with the USPTO for inventor
 Bloc. The application includes a specification and a single claim to the invention which reads as follows:
 
Compound Y. 
(A) In the specification, Bloc explains that compound Y is an intermediate in the chemical
 (B) manufacture of synthetic Z. With respect to synthetic Z, the specification discloses its 
structural
 (C) formula and further states that synthetic Z is modeled on the natural form of Z to give it the same
 therapeutic ability to alleviate pain. The specification goes on to state that synthetic Z is also a
 cure for cancer. On June 2, 2001, the practitioner received an Office action from the primary examiner
 rejecting the claim. The claim is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 as being inoperative; that is, the synthetic
 Z does not operate to produce a cure for cancer (i.e., incredible utility). Bloc believes he is entitled
 to a patent to his compound Y. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in
 the MPEP, how best should the practitioner reply to the rejection of the claim?
"
"
(A) Advise Bloc that he should give up because a cure for cancer is indeed incredible and is unproven.
 
(B) File a reply arguing that a cure for cancer is not incredible and he can prove it if given the chance.
 
(C) File a reply arguing that whether or not a cure for cancer is incredible is superfluous since Bloc
 has disclosed another utility – alleviating pain, which is not incredible. 
(D) File a reply arguing that the claim is directed to compound Y, not synthetic Z. 
(E) File a reply arguing that synthetic Z is modeled on the natural form of Z.

(C) is the best answer. MPEP §§ 2107.01 and 2107.02. MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “Therapeutic or
 Pharmacological Utility,” cites In re Chilowsky, 229 F.2d 457, 461-2, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956);

 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980) as taking the position that “[i]nventions asserted to have utility in
 the treatment of human or animal disorders are subject to the same legal requirements for utility as
 inventions in any other field of technology.” MPEP § 2107.02, under the heading “The Claimed Invention
 Is The Focus Of The Utility Requirement,” states “. . . regardless of the category of invention that
 is claimed (e.g., product or process), an applicant need only make one credible assertion of specific
 utility for the claimed invention to satisfy 35 USC 101 and 35 USC 112; additional statements of utility,
 even if not ""credible,"" do not render the claimed invention lacking in utility. See, e.g., . . . In
 re Gottlieb, 328 F.2d 1016, 1019, 140 USPQ 665, 668 (CCPA 1964) (‘Having found that the antibiotic is
 useful for some purpose, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether it is in fact useful for the other
 purposes 'indicated' in the specification as possibly useful.’).” The issue is whether Mr. Bloc has
 disclosed a specific utility for the claimed compound Y sufficient to satisfy the practical utility
 requirement of 35 U.S.C § 101. According to the set of facts, we know that compound Y is an intermediate
 in the chemical manufacture of synthetic Z. We are given two utilities for synthetic Z: 1) alleviating
 pain, a utility it shares with the natural form of Z; and, 2) curing cancer. The examiner focuses on
 the disclosure that synthetic Z is a cure for cancer. Even if one were to agree that synthetic Z’s ability
 to cure cancer amounts to an incredible utility, a claim to the intermediate compound Y would not run
 afoul of the utility requirement of 35 USC § 101 where another substantial, credible and specific utility
 is alternatively demonstrated. Here, the specification discloses that synthetic Z, like the natural
 form of Z, alleviates pain. The alleviation of pain is another substantial, credible and specific utility
 and serves to give compound Y an alternative utility to that of being used to make a cancer-curing substance.
 An applicant need not show that all disclosed utilities are credible. An applicant need only show that
 one of the disclosed utilities is in fact credible. In re Gottlieb, supra. The establishment of a credible,
 substantial and specific utility renders the disclosure of an additional incredible utility superfluous,
 and therefore ultimately irrelevant. Accordingly, Mr. Bloc’s best course of action is to make the argument
 that he has disclosed another substantial, credible, and specific utility, notwithstanding the disclosure
 of curing cancer.

The specification of a patent application contains limited disclosure of using antisense technology in
 regulating three particular genes in E. coli cells. The specification contains three examples, each
 applying antisense technology to regulating one of the three particular genes in E. coli cells. Despite
 the limited disclosure, the specification states that the “the practices of this invention are generally
 applicable with respect to any organism containing genetic material capable of being expressed such
 as bacteria, yeast, and other cellular organisms.” All of the original claims in the application are
 broadly directed to the application of antisense technology to any cell. No claim is directed to applying
 antisense technology to regulating any of the three particular genes in E. coli cells. The claims are
 rejected under 35 USC 112, first paragraph, for lack of enablement. In support of the rejection, a publication
 is cited that correctly notes antisense technology is highly unpredictable, requiring experimentation
 to ascertain whether the technology works in each type of cell. The publication cites the inventor’s
 own articles (published after the application was filed) that include examples of the inventor’s own
 failures to control the expressions of other genes in E. coli and other types of cells. In accordance
 with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, the rejection is:
"
"
(A) appropriate because the claims are not commensurate in scope with the breadth of enablement inasmuch
 as the working examples in the application are narrow compared to the wide breadth of the claims, the
 unpredictability of the technology, the high quantity of experimentation needed to practice the technology
 in cells other than E. coli. 
(B) appropriate because the claims are not commensurate in scope with the breadth of the enablement inasmuch
 no information is provided proving the technology is safe when applied to animal consumption. 
(C) inappropriate because the claims are commensurate in scope with the breadth of enablement inasmuch
 as the specification discloses that the “the practices of this invention are generally applicable with
 respect to any organism containing genetic material capable of being expressed.” 
(D) inappropriate because the claims are commensurate in scope with the breadth of enablement inasmuch
 as the claims are original, and therefore are self-supporting. 
(E) inappropriate because the claims are commensurate in scope with the breadth of the enablement inasmuch
 as the inventor is not required to theorize or explain why the failures reported in the article occurred.

Inventor files an application containing the following original Claim 1: 
1. A widget comprising element
 A, and element B. 
In a first Office action on the merits, a primary examiner rejects claim 1 under
 35 USC 103 as being obvious over reference X. Reference X explicitly discloses a widget having element
 A, but it does not disclose element B. The examiner, however, takes official notice of the fact that
 element B is commonly associated with element A in the art and on that basis concludes that it would
 have been obvious to provide element B in the reference X widget. In reply to the Office action, the
 registered practitioner representing the applicant makes no amendments, but instead requests reconsideration
 of the rejection by demanding that examiner show proof that element B is commonly associated with element
 A in the art. Which of the following actions, if taken by the examiner in the next Office action would
 be in accord with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP? 

I. Vacate the rejection
 and allow the claim. 
II. Cite a reference that teaches element B is commonly associated with element
 A in the art and make the rejection final. 
III. Deny entry of applicant’s request for reconsideration
 on the ground that it is not responsive to the rejection and allow applicant time to submit a responsive
 amendment.
"
"
(A) I and II only. 
(B) II only. 
(C) II and III only. 
(D) I, II, and III. 
(E) I and III only.
"
"


(A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2144.03 provides that when an applicant seasonably traverses an
 officially noticed fact, the examiner may cite a reference teaching the noticed fact and make the next
 action final. Here, applicant did seasonably traverse the noticed fact by demanding proof in response
 to the rejection. II is therefore an appropriate action by the examiner. I is also an appropriate action
 because the examiner should vacate a rejection based on official notice if no support for the noticed
 fact can be found in response to a challenge by the applicant. See In re Ahlert, 424 F.2d 1088, 1091
 (C.C.P.A. 1970) (“[a]ssertions of technical facts in areas of esoteric technology must always be supported

In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which of the following
 statements regarding operability or enablement of a prior art reference is the most correct?
"
"
(A) The level of disclosure required for a reference to be enabling prior art is no less if the reference
 is a United States patent than if it is a foreign patent. 
(B) A reference is not presumed to be operable merely because it expressly anticipates or makes obvious
 all limitations of an applicant’s claimed apparatus. 
(C) A non-enabling reference may not qualify as prior art for the purpose of determining anticipation
 or obviousness of the claimed invention. 
(D) A reference does not provide an enabling disclosure merely by showing that the public was in possession
 of the claimed invention before the date of the applicant’s invention. 
(E) All of the above are correct.
"
"


(A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2121, under the heading “What Constitutes An ‘Enabling Disclosure’
 Does Not Depend On The Type Of Prior Art The Disclosure Is Contained In,” states, in reliance upon In
 re Moreton, 288 F.2d 708, 711, 129 USPQ 227, 230 (CCPA 1961): “The level of disclosure required within
 a reference to make it an ‘enabling disclosure’ is the same no matter what type of prior art is at issue....

(C) the reference disparages the claimed invention. 
(D) (A), (B) and (C). 
(E) None of the above.
"
"


(E) is the most correct answer. As set forth in MPEP § 2131.05, ""`Arguments that the alleged anticipatory
 prior art is `nonanalogous art' or `teaches away from the invention' or is not recognized as solving
 the problem solved by the claimed invention, [are] not `germane' to a rejection under section 102.'
 Twin Disc, Inc. v. United States, 231 USPQ 417, 424 (Cl.Ct.1986) (quoting In re Self, 671 F.2d 1344,
 213 USPQ 1, 7 (CCPA 1982)). A reference is no less anticipatory if, after disclosing the invention,
 the reference then disparages it. The question whether a reference `teaches away' from the invention
 is inapplicable to an anticipation analysis. Celeritas Technologies Ltd. v. Rockwell International Corp.,

Applicant files a claim which includes the following limitation: ""a step for crossing the road."" The
 specification recites the following acts: ""(1) go to the curb, (2) look both ways, (3) if the road appears
 safe, walk across the road, (4) step up onto the far curb, (5) continue walking."" The primary examiner
 properly construes the step limitation to cover the foregoing acts. A prior art reference, published
 two years before the application was filed, expressly describes acts (1)-(4), but not (5). This same
 reference also discloses the remaining limitations recited in applicant's claim, i.e., those other than
 the step plus function limitation. The examiner rejects the claim under 35 USC 102(b) as being anticipated
 by the prior art reference. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the
 MPEP, which of the following is the most complete reply to overcome the rejection under these circumstances?
"
"
(A) An argument explaining that since act (5) is not disclosed in the reference, it does not anticipate
 the claim. 
(B) An amendment to the specification deleting act (5) – continue walking. 
(C) An argument showing that neither the equivalent of act (5) nor act (5) is disclosed in the reference,
 which therefore does not anticipate the claim. 
(D) An amendment to the claim by adding a negative limitation to expressly exclude act (5) from crossing
 the road. 
(E) (B) and (D).
"
"


(C) is the most correct answer. Pursuant to 35 USC § 112, paragraph 6, In re Donaldson Co., 16 F.3d 1189,
 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1849 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (in banc), and MPEP § 2181, under the heading ""Written Description
 Necessary To Support A Claim Limitation Which Invokes 35 USC 112, Sixth Paragraph,"" ""step"" plus function
 limitations shall be construed to cover the corresponding acts disclosed in the specification and their
 equivalents. Accordingly, the step plus function imitation correspondingly includes acts (1)-(5) and
 their equivalents. Thus, in order to anticipate, a prior art reference must disclose each and every
 act, or its equivalent, for the step plus function. If the reference is shown to not disclose one of
 the acts, or its equivalents, then the reference fails to anticipate, which is the answer set forth
 in (C). Thus, (C) is the most complete answer.

 for pulling the door open. A prior art patent discloses a door opened by pulling on an attached bar.
 The primary examiner issued an Office action rejecting the claim under 35 USC 102 as being anticipated.
 In the action, the examiner properly identified the corresponding structure described in applicant's
 specification as the means for pulling the door open, and properly explained why the prior art attached
 bar is the equivalent of the structure described in applicant's specification. In accordance with the
 patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which of the following is the most correct
 reply to overcome the rejection under these circumstances?
"
"
(A) An amendment to the claim changing the pulling means to expressly include an attached bar. 
(B) Only argue that the claimed pulling means is not found in the prior art relied-upon reference and
 therefore the claim is patentable. (C) An amendment to the specification that adds an attached bar to

(D) An amendment to the claim substituting for the term ""means for pulling the door open"" the structure
 of a handle and a knob. 
(E) An amendment to the specification that excludes an attached bar as a pulling means.
"
"


(D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2181 under the heading ""Procedures For Determining Whether The
 Written Description Adequately Describes The Corresponding Structure, Material, Or Acts Necessary To
 Support A Claim Limitation Which Invokes 35 USC 112, Sixth Paragraph."" 35 USC 112, sixth paragraph states
 that a claim limitation expressed in means plus function language ""shall be construed to cover the corresponding
 structure, materials, or acts described in the specification and `equivalents thereof.' See also B.
 Braun Medical, Inc. v. Abbott Lab., 124 F.3d 1419, 1424, 43 USPQ2d 1896, 1899 (Fed. Cir. 1997)."" The
 examiner has made a prima facie case of equivalent in the Office action to support the rejection based
 on 35 USC § 102. By amending the claim to no longer include the means limitation in question, the claim
 becomes narrower inasmuch as it no longer includes equivalents under 35 USC § 112, paragraph 6 for examination
 purposes. Thus, (D) overcomes the lack of novelty rejection under these circumstances.

A registered practitioner files a patent application with the following claim: 
1. A plastic insert for
 the bottom of a shopping cart comprising circular receptacles to receive wine bottles and to maintain
 them in an upright and stable position even while the shopping cart is moved about a store so that they
 do not fall and break. 
Patent A discloses a plastic insert for the bottom of a shopping cart comprising
 rectangular receptacles to receive cereal boxes and to maintain them in an upright and stable position
 even while the shopping cart is moved about a store in order to keep them organized in the cart. Patent
 A also discloses that the receptacles could be any circular diameter to receive complementary shaped
 bottles or jars such as to securely hold 2-liter soft drink bottles or mayonnaise jars. A primary examiner
 rejected the claim as being obvious under 35 USC 103 over Patent A reasoning that Patent A suggests
 to one of ordinary skill in the art an insert for a shopping cart with circular receptacles for the
 purpose of stably maintaining any bottle, including wine bottles, while pushing the cart about a store
 so that the cart remains organized. Assume the examiner has made a sufficient prima facie case of obviousness.
 Following receipt of the rejection, the practitioner filed a timely reply. The practitioner argued that
 Patent A does not render obvious the claimed subject matter because there is no suggestion of a plastic
 insert to keep a wine bottle from falling and breaking in a shopping cart. Which of the following best
 explains why, in accordance with the patent laws, rules and the procedures as related in the MPEP, the
 examiner should or should not be persuaded by the practitioner’s argument?
"
"
(A) No, because Patent A suggests circular receptacles for any complementary bottle, albeit for a different
 purpose. 
(B) Yes, because there is no suggestion in Patent A that the plastic insert can hold a wine bottle. 
(C)
 Yes, because the claim uses the insert to keep the bottles from falling and breaking while Patent A
 uses the insert to keep the cart organized. 
(D) Yes, because Patent A is more interested in organizing boxes than holding bottles. 
(E) Yes, because the prevention from breakage is an unexpected property of the plastic insert.
"
"


(A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2144, under the heading “Rationale Different From Applicant’s
 Is Permissible.” Patent A suggests an insert with receptacles that are circular and which can be shaped
 to complement the shape of the object to be received. The purpose for this in Patent A is to keep the
 cart organized, not as in the claim to prevent the object from falling and breaking. The difference
 in objectives does not defeat the case for obviousness because, as MPEP § 2144 states, the “reason or
 motivation to modify the reference may often suggest what the inventor has done, but for a different
 purpose or to solve a different problem. It is not necessary that the prior art suggest the combination
 to achieve the same advantage or result discovered by applicant. In re Linter, 458 F.2d 1013, 173 USPQ
 560 (CCPA 1972) ...; In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500
 U.S. 904 (1991) ... .” In other words, it does not matter that Patent A does not appreciate the claimed
 purpose of preventing breakage. It suggests an insert with receptacles to hold bottles. That is enough
 to render the claimed subject matter prima facie obvious. The prima facie case is not rebutted by arguing
 that the purpose for the claimed insert is different form that specified for the insert described in
 Patent A.

In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which of the following
 statements regarding publications as references is incorrect?
"
"
(A) A doctoral thesis indexed and shelved in a library can be sufficiently accessible to the public to
 constitute prior art as a printed publication. 
(B) Evidence showing routine business practices is never sufficient to establish the date on which a
 publication became accessible to the public. 
(C) A paper which is orally presented in a forum open to all interested persons can constitute a “printed
 publication” if written copies are disseminated without restriction. 
(D) Documents distributed only internally within an organization, which has an existing policy of confidentiality
 or agreement to remain confidential are not “printed publications” even if many copies are distributed.
 
(E) A publication disseminated by mail is not available as prior art until it is received by at least
 one member of the public.
"
"


(B) is the most proper answer. MPEP § 2128.02, under the heading “Date of Accessibility Can Be Shown
 Through Evidence of Routine Business Practices,” states, in reliance upon Constant v. Advanced Micro-Devices,
 Inc., 848 F.2d 1560, 7 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 988 U.S. 892 (1988), and In re Hall, 781
 F.2d 897, 228 USPQ 453 (Fed. Cir. 1986), “Evidence showing routine business practices can be used to

The claimed invention in a patent application is directed to an explosive composition “comprising 60-90%
 solid ammonium nitrate, and 10-40% water-in-oil in which sufficient aeration is entrapped to enhance
 sensitivity to a substantial degree.” The application discloses that the explosive requires both fuel
 (the ammonium nitrate), and oxygen to “sensitize the composition.” A prior art reference, published
 more than two years before the effective filing date of the application, discloses explosive compositions
 containing water-in-oil emulsions having identical ingredients to those claimed, in ranges overlapping
 with the claimed composition. The only element of the claim not recited in the reference is “sufficient
 aeration entrapped to enhance sensitivity to a substantial degree.” The reference does not recognize
 that sufficient aeration sensitizes the fuel to a substantial degree. In addition to the prior art reference,
 a printed publication contains test data demonstrating that “sufficient aeration” is necessarily an
 inherent element in the prior art blasting composition under the circumstances. In accordance with the
 patent laws, rules and the procedures as related in the MPEP, the prior art reference:
"
"
(A) anticipates the claim because it discloses every limitation of the claim either explicitly or inherently.
 
(B) does not anticipate the claim because the prior art reference does not recognize an inherent property.
 
(C) does not anticipate the claim because the prior art reference does not recognize an inherent function
 of oxygen. 
(D) does not anticipate the claim because the prior art reference does not recognize an inherent ingredient,
 oxygen. 
(E) (B), (C) and (D).

(A) is the best answer. 35 USC § 102; MPEP § 2131.01, under the heading “Extra Reference or Evidence
 Can Be Used To Show an Inherent Characteristic of the Thing Taught by the Primary Reference,” states
 “that as long as there is evidence of record establishing inherency, failure of those skilled in the
 art to contemporaneously recognize an inherent property, function or ingredient of a prior art reference
 does not preclude a finding of anticipation. Atlas Powder Co. v. IRECO, Inc., 190 F.3d 1342, 1349, 51
 USPQ2d 1943, 1948 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Two prior art references disclosed blasting compositions containing

(A) An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F, supported by
 an affidavit showing that the mixture Y made by process Q2 exhibits a melting point of 300° F.

 declaration stating only that the processes are different. 
(C) An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F, supported by
 a third-party declaration stating only that the products are different. 
(D) An argument that the processes used by applicant and patent A are different, supported by an affidavit
 showing that the mixture Y made by process Q2 exhibits a melting point of 300° F. 
(E) An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F because the
 claimed mixture Y has a melting point of 150° F and the mixture Y of patent A has a melting point of
 300° F.
"
"


(A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading ""Product-By-Process Claims Are Not Limited
 To The Manipulations Of The Recited Steps, Only The Structure Implied By The Steps,"" states ""'even though
 product-byprocess claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability is
 based on the product itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production.
 If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior
 art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.' In re
 Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985)."" The issue is whether the claimed mixture
 Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y. MPEP § 2113, under the heading ""Once A Product
 Appearing To Be Substantially Identical Is Found And A 35 USC 102/103 Rejection Made, The Burden Shifts
 To The Applicant To Show An Unobvious Difference,"" states ""[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale
 tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art,
 although produced by a different process, the burden shifts to applicant to come forward with evidence
 establishing an unobvious difference between the claimed product and the prior art product. In re Marosi,
 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983)."" Evidence that the two processes produce different
 properties is germane to the issue of patentability of the product-by-process claim. Accordingly, a
 comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process
 used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point
 would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical,
 in fact, they are patentably different. Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989).
 Therefore, the best reply to the outstanding rejection would be to argue that the claimed product has
 an unexpectedly lower melting point and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result
 of the patent A process is a mixture with higher melting point as compared to the claimed product. (B)
 is incorrect. The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product
 characteristics, not process steps.

(E) An offer to sale the patent rights in the claimed subject matter.
"
"


(E) is the most correct answer. As set forth in MPEP § 2133.03(b), under the heading “I The Meaning Of
 ‘Sale’,” subheading “A Sale of Rights Is Not a Sale of the Invention and Will Not in Itself Bar a Patent,”
 “[a]n assignment or sale of the rights, such as patent rights, in the invention is not a sale of ‘the
 invention’ within the meaning of section 102(b). The sale must involve the delivery of the physical
 invention itself. Moleculon Research Corp. v. CBS, Inc., 793 F.2d 1261, 1265, 229 USPQ 805, 809 (Fed.
 Cir. 1986).”

The specification of an application does not disclose the utility of the claimed composition. In fact,
 the claimed invention is useful for shrinking a specific class of tumors. In a first Office action,
 the primary examiner has properly determined that the claims lack utility, and has rejected all of the
 composition claims under the first paragraph of 35 USC 112 as lacking utility. Which of the following
 responses is in accord with the USPTO rules and the procedures of the MPEP for persuading the examiner
 that the rejection is improper?
"
"
(A) Explain that the rejection is statutorily improper because the first paragraph of section 112 is
 concerned with enablement and written description issues and therefore does not support a rejection
 for lack of utility. 
(B) Point out that the rejection is based on an erroneous finding by the examiner because the specification,
 in fact, clearly discloses that the composition in question possesses ""useful biological"" properties.
 
(C) Show that the rejection is improper by filing probative evidence that the claimed composition has
 unambiguously proven to be useful for shrinking a specific class of tumors. 
(D) File declarations by persons with ordinary skill in the art stating that they would immediately appreciate
 that the claimed composition is useful for shrinking a specific class of tumors due to the fact that
 similar compositions having the same characteristics as applicant's claimed composition were known to
 be effective for this purpose. 
(E) Argue that the rejection is improper because the examiner has failed to present evidence in support
 of his position that the claimed composition has no utility.
"
"


(D) is most correct answer. As explained at MPEP § 2107.02, II, B, under the heading ""No Statement of
 Utility for the Claimed Invention in the Specification Does Not Per Se Negate Utility,"" the fact that
 a specification does not contain a statement of utility for the claimed invention does not per se negate
 utility. This is because a claimed invention may have a well- established utility, and an invention
 has a well-established utility if (i) a person of ordinary skill in the art would imme diately appreciate
 why the invention is useful based on the characteristics of the invention and (ii) the utility is specific,
 substantial, and credible. In this case, the declarations specify a specific substantial and credible
 utility and explain why the declarants (i.e., persons of ordinary skill in the art) would immediately
 appreciate that the applicant's claimed composition would possess this utility.

In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which of the following
 statements regarding claim interpretation is the most correct?
"
"
(A) A claim having the transition term “comprising” is limited to only the limitations, elements or steps
 recited in the claim, and is not inclusive or open-ended of other unrecited elements or steps. 
(B) The transition term “consisting essentially of” limits the claim to the limitations recited in the
 claim and additional elements or steps which do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics
 of the claimed invention. 
(C) A claim having the transition term “consisting of” is not limited to the elements or steps recited
 in the claim, but can include elements or steps other than those recited in addition to any impurities
 ordinarily associated therewith. 
(D) A claim which depends from a claim which claims an invention “consisting of” the recited elements
 or steps can add an element or step to further limit the claimed invention. 
(E) All of the above.

A primary examiner is examining a patent application. The application includes a specification and a
 single claim to the invention that reads as follows: 
1. A building material to be used as an alternative
 to brick in the construction of a house, said building material comprising compressed refuse, the majority
 of which is wood. 
In the specification, the inventor explains that the wood to be used in the inventive
 building material should be balsa wood. According to the specification, balsa-containing building material
 has the advantage of being lighter than brick. In a first Office action mailed to the registered practitioner
 representing the inventor the single claim was rejected as anticipated under 35 U.S.C. § 102 over Patent
 A. Patent A issued more than one year before the effective filing date of the application, and teaches
 a building material to be used as an alternative to brick in the construction of a house comprising
 compressed refuse, the majority of which is pine. The practitioner replies to the first Office action
 by arguing that the invention is different from that of Patent A. According to the practitioner, the
 inventor uses balsa wood, not pine. The claim has not been amended. Which of the following describes
 how the examiner should proceed in accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related

"
(A) The examiner should allow the claim. 
(B) The examiner should allow the claim only after including a Reasons for Allowance pointing out that
 the inventor argues that her invention is directed to using balsa wood, not pine.

 over Patent A. 
(D) The examiner should reopen prosecution and begin anew, this time searching for a reference that shows
 a building material containing balsa wood. 
(E) The examiner should withdraw the rejection but issue a new Office action this time rejecting the
 claim under 35 USC 112, second paragraph, because the claim is broad enough to encompass using pine.

The Potter patent application was filed on June 6, 2002, claiming subject matter invented by Potter.
 The Potter application properly claims priority to a German application filed on June 6, 2001. A first
 Office action contains a rejection of all the claims of the application under 35 USC 103(a) based on
 a U.S. patent application publication to Smith in view of a U.S. patent to Jones. A registered practitioner
 prosecuting the Potter application ascertains that the relevant subject matter in Smith's published
 application and Potter's claimed invention were, at the time Potter's invention was made, owned by ABC
 Company or subject to an obligation of assignment to ABC Company. The practitioner also observes that
 the Smith patent application was filed on April 10, 2001 and that the patent application was published
 on December 5, 2002. Smith and Potter do not claim the same patentable invention. To overcome the rejection
 without amending the claims, which of the following timely replies would comply with the USPTO rules
 and the procedures set forth in the MPEP to be an effective reply for overcoming the rejection?
"
"
(A) A reply that only contains arguments that Smith fails to teach all the elements in the only independent
 claim, and which specifically points out the claimed element that Smith lacks. 
(B) A reply that properly states that the invention of the Potter application and the Smith application
 were commonly owned by ABC Company at the time of the invention of the Potter application. 
(C) A reply that consists of an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.132 stating that the affiant
 has never seen the invention in the Potter application before. 
(D) A reply that consists of an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.131 properly proving invention
 of the claimed subject matter of Potter application only prior to June 6, 2001. 
(E) A reply that consists of a proper terminal disclaimer and affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.130.

(B) is the most correct answer. See 35 USC § 103(a); MPEP §§ 706.02(1)(1) and 2145. The prior art exception
 in 35 USC § 103(c) is applicable because the Smith reference is only prior art under 35 USC § 102(e),

On January 2, 2001, a registered practitioner filed a patent application with the USPTO for inventor
 Beck. The application includes a specification and a single claim to the invention which reads as follows:
 
1. Mixture Y made by the process Q1. 
In the specification, Mr. Beck discloses that mixture Y has a
 melting point of 150° F. On June 2, 2001, the practitioner received an Office action from the primary
 examiner rejecting the claim. The claim is rejected under 35 USC 102/103 as being clearly anticipated
 by or obvious over Patent A. The examiner states “Patent A teaches mixture Y but made by a different
 process Q2.” Beck believes he is entitled to a patent to mixture Y. In accordance with USPTO rules and
 procedures set forth in the MPEP, which of the following would be the best reply to the rejection of
 his claim?
"
"
(A) An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F, supported by
 an affidavit showing that the mixture Y made by process Q2 exhibits a melting point of 300° F. 
(B) An argument that the processes used by applicant and patent A are different, supported by a third-party
 declaration stating only that the processes are different. 
(C) An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F, supported by
 a third-party declaration stating only that the products are different. 
(D) An argument that the processes used by applicant and patent A are different, supported by an affidavit
 showing that the mixture Y made by process Q2 exhibits a melting point of 300° F. 
(E) An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F because the
 claimed mixture Y has a melting point of 150° F and the mixture Y of patent A has a melting point of
 300° F.
"
"


(A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By-Process Claims Are Not Limited
 To The Manipulations Of The Recited Steps, Only The Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “‘even though
 product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability
 is based on the product itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production.
 If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior
 art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.’ In re
 Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).” The issue is whether the claimed mixture
 Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Once A Product
 Appearing To Be Substantially Identical Is Found And A 35 USC 102/103 Rejection Made, The Burden Shifts
 To The Applicant To Show An Unobvious Difference,” states “[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale
 tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art,
 although produced by a different process, the burden shifts to applicant to come forward with evidence
 establishing an unobvious difference between the claimed product and the prior art product. In re Marosi,
 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983).” Evidence that the two processes produce different
 properties is germane to the issue of patentability of the product- by-process claim. Accordingly, a
 comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process
 used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point
 would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical,
 in fact, they are patentably different. Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989).
 Therefore, the best reply to the outstanding rejection would be to argue that the claimed product has
 an unexpectedly lower melting point and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result
 of the patent A process is a mixture with higher melting point as compared to the claimed product.

A claim in a pending patent application for an electric toothbrush is rejected under 35 USC 102 as being
 anticipated by a U.S. Patent, which was issued to Lancer, the sole name inventor, for a similar electric
 toothbrush. The Lancer patent was issued one day before the filing date of the application in question.
 The claim in the pending application contains a limitation specifying the location of an on/off switch.
 In accordance with USPTO rules and procedures set forth in the MPEP, which of the following arguments,
 if true, would overcome the rejection?
"
"
(A) The Lancer patent discloses and claims an electric toothbrush, but does not mention whether its toothbrush
 includes a power supply. 
(B) Evidence is submitted to show the electric toothbrush claimed in the application is commercially
 successful. 
(C) The Lancer patent teaches away from the bristles of the claimed toothbrush. 
(D) Lancer is one of the three named inventors of the claimed toothbrush in the pending application.
 
(E) The on/off switch in the Lancer patent is on a different side of the body than that recited in the
 claim for the electric toothbrush in the patent application.
"
"


(A) and (E) are accepted as correct answers. Regarding (E), see MPEP § 2131. To anticipate a claim, the
 elements of a reference “must be arranged as required by the claim....” See MPEP § 2131, citing In re
 Bond, 910 F.2d 831, 15 USPQ2d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In (E), the on/off switch of Lancer’s toothbrush
 is arranged differently than that of the claimed toothbrush. (A) is accepted as correct because the
 given facts do not specify the location of the power supply as being included within the toothbrush.
 Though the description of the toothbrush as being electric can imply an inherent source of power, it
 may also may imply an external power source for the electric toothbrush. Accordingly, (A) is also accepted
 as a correct answer in the circumstances.

A claim in an application recites ""[a] composition containing: (a) 35-55% polypropylene; and (b) 45-65%
 polyethylene."" The sole prior art reference describes, as the only relevant disclosure, a composition
 containing 34.9% polypropylene and 65.1% polyethylene. In accordance with USPTO rules and procedures
 set forth in the MPEP, the primary examiner should properly:
"
"
(A) Indicate the claim allowable over the prior art because there is no teaching, motivation or 
suggestion to increase the amount of polypropylene from 34.9% to 35% and decrease the amount of polyethylene
 from 65.1% to 65%. 
(B) Reject the claim under 35 USC 102 as anticipated by the prior art reference. 
(C) Reject the claim under 35 USC 103 as obvious over the prior art reference. 
(D) Reject the claim alternatively under 35 USC 102 as anticipated by or under 35 USC 103 as 
obvious over the prior art reference. 
(E) None of the above.
"
"


(C) is the most correct answer. A prima facie case of obviousness exists where the claimed ranges and
 the prior art are close enough that one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected them to have
 the same properties. See MPEP § 2144.05. In Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775, 783, 227
 USPQ 773, 779 (Fed. Cir. 1985), a claim recited a titanium base alloy consisting essentially of 0.8%
 nickel, 0.3% molybdenum, up to 0.1% maximum iron, and the balance titanium. A prior art reference described
 two similar alloys: (i) one with 0.25% molybdenum, 0.75% nickel, and balance titanium; and (ii) another
 with 0.31% molybdenum, 0.94% nickel, and balance titanium. The court held: “As admitted by appellee's
 affidavit evidence from James A. Hall, the Russian article discloses two alloys having compositions
 very close to that of claim 3, which is 0.3% Mo and 0.8% Ni, balance titanium. The two alloys in the
 prior art have 0.25% Mo-0.75% Ni and 0.31% Mo-0.94% Ni, respectively. The proportions are so close that
 prima facie one skilled in the art would have expected them to have the same properties. Appellee produced
 no evidence to rebut that prima facie case. The specific alloy of claim 3 must therefore be considered
 to have been obvious from known alloys. Id.”

On January 2, 2001, a registered practitioner filed a patent application with the USPTO for inventor
 Bloc. The application includes a specification and a single claim to the invention which reads as follows:
 
1. Compound Y. 
In the specification, Bloc explains that compound Y is an intermediate in the chemical
 manufacture of synthetic Z. With respect to synthetic Z, the specification discloses its structural
 formula and further states that synthetic Z is modeled on the natural form of Z to give it the same
 therapeutic ability to alleviate pain. The specification goes on to state that synthetic Z is also a
 cure for cancer. On June 2, 2001, the practitioner received an Office action from the primary examiner
 rejecting the claim. The claim is rejected under 35 USC 101 as being inoperative; that is, the synthetic
 Z does not operate to produce a cure for cancer (i.e., incredible utility). Bloc believes he is entitled
 to a patent to his compound Y. In accordance with USPTO rules and procedures set forth in the MPEP,
 how best should the practitioner reply to the rejection of the claim?
"
"
(A) Advise Bloc that he should give up because a cure for cancer is indeed incredible and is unproven.
 
(B) File a reply arguing that a cure for cancer is not incredible and he can prove it if given the chance.
 
(C) File a reply arguing that whether or not a cure for cancer is incredible is superfluous since Bloc
 has disclosed another utility – alleviating pain, which is not incredible. 
(D) File a reply arguing that the claim is directed to compound Y, not synthetic Z. 
(E) File a reply arguing that synthetic Z is modeled on the natural form of Z.

(C) is the best answer. MPEP §§ 2107.01 and 2107.02. MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “Therapeutic or
 Pharmacological Utility,” cites In re Chilowsky, 229 F.2d 457, 461-2, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956);
 In re Gazave; and Nelson v. Bowler, as taking the position that “[i]nventions asserted to have utility
 in the treatment of human or animal disorders are subject to the same legal requirements for utility
 as inventions in any other field of technology.” MPEP § 2107.02, under the heading “The Claimed Invention
 Is The Focus Of The Utility Requirement,” states “...regardless of the category of invention that is
 claimed (e.g., product or process), an applicant need only make one credible assertion of specific utility
 for the claimed invention to satisfy 35 USC 101 and 35 USC 112; additional statements of utility, even
 if not “credible,” do not render the claimed invention lacking in utility. See, e.g.,...In re Gottlieb,
 328 F.2d 1016, 1019, 140 USPQ 665, 668 (CCPA 1964) (‘Having found that the antibiotic is useful for
 some purpose, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether it is in fact useful for the other purposes ‘indicated’
 in the specification as possibly useful.’).” The issue is whether Mr. Bloc has disclosed a specific
 utility for the claimed compound Y sufficient to satisfy the practical utility requirement of 35 U.S.C
 § 101. According to the set of facts, we know that compound Y is an intermediate in the chemical manufacture
 of synthetic Z. We are given two utilities for synthetic Z: 1) alleviating pain, a utility it shares
 with the natural form of Z; and, 2) curing cancer. The examiner focuses on the disclosure that synthetic
 Z is a cure for cancer. Even if one were to agree that synthetic Z’s ability to cure cancer amounts
 to an incredible utility, a claim to the intermediate compound Y would not run afoul of the utility
 requirement of 35 USC § 101 where another substantial, credible and specific utility is alternatively
 demonstrated. Here, the specification discloses that synthetic Z, like the natural form of Z, alleviates
 pain. The alleviation of pain is another substantial, credible and specific utility and serves to give
 compound Y an alternative utility to that of being used to make a cancer-curing substance. An applicant
 need not show that all disclosed utilities are credible. An applicant need only show that one of the
 disclosed utilities is in fact credible. In re Gottlieb, supra. The establishment of a credible, substantial
 and specific utility renders the disclosure of an additional incredible utility superfluous, and therefore
 ultimately irrelevant. Accordingly, Mr. Bloc’s best course of action is to make the argument that he
 has disclosed another substantial, credible, and specific utility, notwithstanding the disclosure of
 curing cancer.

On January 2, 2001, a registered practitioner filed a patent application with the USPTO for inventor
 Bloc. The application includes a specification and a single claim to the invention which reads as follows:
 
1. Compound Y. 
In the specification, Bloc explains that compound Y is an intermediate in the chemical
 manufacture of synthetic Z. With respect to synthetic Z, the specification discloses its structural
 formula and further states that synthetic Z is modeled on the natural form of Z to give it the same
 therapeutic ability to alleviate pain. The specification goes on to state that synthetic Z is also a
 cure for cancer. On June 2, 2001, the practitioner received an Office action from the primary examiner
 rejecting the claim. The claim is rejected under 35 USC 101 as being inoperative; that is, the synthetic
 Z does not operate to produce a cure for cancer (i.e., incredible utility). Bloc believes he is entitled
 to a patent to his compound Y. In accordance with USPTO rules and procedures set forth in the MPEP,
 how best should the practitioner reply to the rejection of the claim?
"
"
(A) Advise Bloc that he should give up because a cure for cancer is indeed incredible and is unproven.
 
(B) File a reply arguing that a cure for cancer is not incredible and he can prove it if given the chance.
 
(C) File a reply arguing that whether or not a cure for cancer is incredible is superfluous since Bloc
 has disclosed another utility – alleviating pain, which is not incredible. 
(D) File a reply arguing that the claim is directed to compound Y, not synthetic Z. 
(E) File a reply arguing that synthetic Z is modeled on the natural form of Z.

Smith invented a laminate. In a patent application, Smith most broadly disclosed the laminate as comprising
 a transparent protective layer in continuous, direct contact with a light-sensitive layer without any
 intermediate layer between the transparent protective layer and the light- sensitive layer. The prior
 art published two years before the effective filing date of Smith's application included a laminate
 containing a transparent protective layer and a light-sensitive layer held together by an intermediate
 adhesive layer. Which of the following is a proper claim that would overcome a 35 U.S.C. § 102 rejection
 based on the prior art?
"
"
(A) A laminate comprising a transparent protective layer and a light-sensitive layer. 
(B) A laminate comprising a transparent protective layer and a light-sensitive layer which is in continuous
 and direct contact with the transparent protective layer. 
(C) A laminate comprising a transparent protective layer and a light-sensitive layer, but not including
 an adhesive layer. 
(D) (A) and (B). 
(E) (B) and (C).
"
"


(E) is correct because (B) and (C) are correct. (B) overcomes a 35 USC § 102 rejection because the claim
 requires a light-sensitive layer to be in continuous and direct contact with the transparent protective
 layer, whereas the prior art interposes an adhesive layer between the light-sensitive layer and transparent

(A) Since claim 20 was omitted from the divisional application as filed, it cannot be added to the divisional
 application by a subsequent Amendment because such an Amendment would constitute new matter. 
(B) It was improper to include Tommie and Jo as joint inventors in the parent application. 
(C) The examiner may properly make a provisional obviousness-type double patenting rejection in the divisional
 application based on the parent application, but that rejection may be readily overcome with the filing
 of a terminal disclaimer. 
(D) Because the inventive entity of the amended parent application is different than the inventive entity
 of the divisional application, the examiner may reject the claims of the divisional application under
 the provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 102(e). 
(E) Statements (A), (B), (C) and (D) are each incorrect.
"
"


(E). Statement (A) is incorrect at least because the parent application, which included claim 20, was
 incorporated by reference. Therefore, adding claim 20 does not constitute the addition of new matter.
 Statement (B) is wrong because at least claim 20 is properly viewed as a joint invention (“Jo and Tommie
 collaborated to invent a method to cleanup toxic waste spills using the chemical made according to the
 unobvious technique invented by Jo”). MPEP §§ 605.07, item (E), and 2137.01. Under 35 USC § 116, inventors
 may apply for a patent jointly even if they did not make the same type or amount of contribution and
 did not each make a contribution to the subject matter of every claim of the patent. Statement (C) is
 wrong because 35 USC § 121 precludes such a rejection. Statement (D) is wrong at least because Tommie

"
"
(A) Where a patent discloses subject matter being claimed in an application undergoing examination, if
 the patent’s designation of inventorship differs from that of the application, then the patent’s designation
 of inventorship does not raise a presumption of inventorship regarding the subject matter disclosed
 but not claimed in the patent so as to justify a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(f). 
(B) The fact that a claim recites various components, all of which can be argumentatively assumed to
 be old, provides a proper basis for a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(f). 
(C) A person can be an inventor without having contributed to the conception of the invention. 
(D) In arriving at conception, an inventor may not consider and adopt ideas and materials derived from
 other sources such as an employee or hired consultant. 
(E) It is essential for the inventor to be personally involved in reducing the invention to actual practice.
"
"


(A) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2137, p.2100-89. (B) is incorrect. The mere fact that the
 claim recites components, all of which can be argumentatively assumed to be old, does not provide a
 basis for rejection under 35 USC § 102(f). Ex parte Billottet, 192 USPQ 413, 415 (Bd. App. 1976); MPEP§

"
"
(A) Filing a reply, on March 9, 2000, with a petition for a three-month extension and the fee for a three-month

 for bonding semiconductor materials to metals, and therefore does not disclose all the elements of Claim
 1. 
(B) Filing a reply, on September 9, 1999, traversing the rejection on the ground that Gold does not disclose
 using the composition for bonding semi-conductor materials to metals, and therefore does not disclose
 all the elements of Claim 1. 
(C) Filing a reply on October 9, 1999, amending Claim 1 to state as follows: “Claim 1. A composition
 comprising: 20%A, 20%B, and 60%D.” In the reply, pointing out why the amendment gives the claim patentable
 novelty. 
(D) Filing a reply on October 9, 1999, traversing the rejection on the grounds that the patent to Gold
 teaches away from using the invention in the manner taught in Bond’s application. 
(E) Filing (i) a 37 C.F.R. § 1.132 affidavit objectively demonstrating the commercial success of the

In June 1998, Jack and Jill, a married couple, are vacationing in Vietnam (not a WTO country) when they
 encounter a man selling bamboo knives for cleaning fish. The particular curvature of the bamboo both
 lends support to the knife to prevent it from bending and breaking and facilitates cleaning inside the
 fish. Jill takes a picture of Jack with the knife cleaning the fish. Subsequently, in November 1998,
 when Jack returns to the United States he begins to make and sell an identical knife to the one seen
 in Vietnam. In July 1999, he files a patent application claiming the nearly identical knife. Jack discloses
 no prior art during the prosecution of his application and fails to mention the knife he saw in Vietnam.
 The examiner finds no prior art similar to the claimed knife, and Jack is awarded a patent in December
 2000. Meanwhile, Jill divorces Jack, and associates with Sam. Unfortunately, Sam is penniless. To raise
 cash, Sam and Jill begin selling a knife identical to the one Jack produces, only Sam and Jill make
 their knife out of plastic. The knives of Sam and Jill sell like hotcakes. Jack sues for infringement.
 Jill and Sam come to you for advice. Which of the following is not true?
"
"
(A) Jack is entitled to patent protection since Vietnam is not a WTO country and evidence of the Vietnamese
 knife cannot be used against him to reject his patent claims. 
(B) Jack had a duty under 37 C.F.R. §1.56 to disclose his discovery of the bamboo knife in Vietnam to
 the examiner during the original patent prosecution. 
(C) Since the use in Vietnam was not in this country, it does not constitute a public use bar under 35
 U.S.C. § 102(b). 
(D) If Jill’s attorney files a request for reexamination, it will be denied because the picture is not
 a patent or printed publication. 
(E) Although Jack marketed the invention before obtaining a patent, the patent claims cannot be invalidated
 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) since Jack’s making and selling of the knife cannot be used against him under
 35 U.S.C. § 102(a).
"
"


(A) is the most correct answer. Answer (A) is not true since Jack did not invent the knife, therefore
 he is not entitled to a patent. Jack derived the invention from another, and the picture of Jack with
 the Vietnamese knife is evidence of derivation. 35 USC § 102(f); MPEP § 2137.

 conforms to proper USPTO practice and procedure?
"

(A) A deficiency under 35 U.S.C. § 101 also creates a deficiency under 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph.
 
(B) To overcome a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 101, it must be shown that the claimed device is capable
 of achieving a useful result on all occasions and under all conditions. 
(C) A claimed invention is properly rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 101 as lacking utility if the particular
 embodiment disclosed in the patent lacks perfection or performs crudely. 
(D) To overcome a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 101, it is essential to show that the claimed invention
 accomplishes all its intended functions. 
(E) A claimed invention lacks utility if it is not commercially successful.
"
"


The most correct answer is (A). As stated in MPEP § 2107.01 (IV). A deficiency under 35 USC § 101 also
 creates a deficiency under 35 USC § 112, first paragraph. See In re Brana; In re Fouche, (“If such compositions

"
"
(A) A written description as filed in a nonprovisional patent application is presumed adequate under
 35 U.S.C. § 112 in the absence of evidence or reasoning to the contrary. 
(B) An examiner may show that a written description as filed in a nonprovisional patent application is
 not adequate by presenting a preponderance of evidence why a person of ordinary skill in the art would
 not recognize in the applicant’s disclosure a description of the invention defined by the claims. 
(C) A general allegation of “unpredictability in the art” is sufficient to support a rejection of a claim
 for lack of an adequate written description. 
(D) When filing an amendment, a practitioner should show support in the original disclosure for new or
 amended claims. 
(E) When there is substantial variation within a genus, an applicant must describe a sufficient variety
 of species to reflect the variation within the genus.

A U.S. patent application discloses a first embodiment of an invention, a composition made of known materials
 in equal amounts by weight of A, B, and C. The application discloses a second embodiment of the invention
 comprising equal amounts by weight of A, B, and C, and an effective amount of D, a known material, to
 reduce excess moisture from the composition. The application also discloses a third embodiment of the
 invention comprising equal amounts by weight of A, B, and C, and an effective amount of D to reduce
 the acidity of the composition. The application fully discloses guidelines for determining an effective
 amount of D to reduce excess moisture from the composition, and determining an effective amount of D
 to reduce the acidity of the composition. The application discloses that the amount of D needed to reduce
 excess moisture from the composition differs from the amount of D needed to reduce the acidity of the
 composition. Which of the following claims, if included in the application, provides a proper basis
 for a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph?
"
"
(A) Claim 1. A composition comprising: equal amounts by weight of A, B, and C, and an effective amount
 of D to reduce the acidity of the composition. 
(B) Claim 1. A composition comprising: equal amounts by weight of A, B, and C, and an effective amount
 of D. 
(C) Claim 1. A composition comprising: equal amounts by weight of A, B, and C, and an effective amount
 of D to reduce excess moisture from the composition. 
(D) Claim 1. A composition comprising: equal amounts by weight of A, B, and C. 
(E) None of the above.
"
"


(B) is the correct answer. 35 USC § 112, second paragraph and MPEP § 2173.05(c)(III). The claim presented
 in (B) is improper as “an effective amount” has been held to be indefinite when the claim fails to state
 the function that is to be achieved and more than one effect can be implied from the specification.
 In re Fredericksen 213 F.2d 547, 102 USPQ 35 (CCPA 1954). It is unclear whether “an effective amount”
 in (B) is an effective amount to reduce acidity or an effective amount to reduce moisture.

 specification of the holder being a clasp, crimp, or tong. 
(B) An amendment to the specification and claims changing the definition of “holder” from “is a hook”
 to “is a hook, clasp, crimp, or tong.” The amendment is filed one month after the application was filed.
 There was no previous supporting disclosure in the specification of the holder being a clasp, crimp,

A patent application filed in the USPTO claims a nylon rope coated with element E for the purpose of
 preventing breakage of the rope. In the first Office action, the examiner rejects the claim as obvious
 over P in view of a trade journal publication, T. P teaches a nylon rope coated with resin for the purpose
 of making the rope waterproof. T teaches a nylon tent fabric coated with element E for the purpose of
 making the tent waterproof, and suggests the use of element E for making other nylon products waterproof.
 Following proper USPTO practices and procedures, the combination of P and T:
"
"
(A) cannot support a prima facie case of obviousness because T lacks a suggestion to combine with P for
 the purpose of preventing breakage in nylon rope. 
(B) cannot support a prima facie case of obviousness because P lacks a suggestion to combine with T for
 the purpose of preventing breakage in nylon rope. 
(C) cannot support a prima facie case of obviousness because T only contains a suggestion to combine
 with P for the purpose of waterproofing nylon rope. 
(D) can support a prima facie case of obviousness, even though T only contains a suggestion to combine
 with P for the purpose of waterproofing nylon rope. 
(E) can support a prima facie case of obviousness because the applicant is always under an obligation
 to submit evidence of non-obviousness regardless of whether the examiner fully establishes a prima facie
 case of obviousness.
"
"


(D). “It is not necessary in order to establish a prima facie case of obviousness...that there be a suggestion
 or expectation from the prior art that the claimed [invention] will have the same or a similar utility
 as one newly discovered by the applicant.” In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 692, 16 USPQ2d 1897, 1900 (Fed.
 Cir. 1990) (emphasis in original). Thus, “[i]t is not necessary that the prior art suggest the combination
 to achieve the same advantage or result discovered by applicant.” MPEP § 2144 (“Rationale Different
 from Applicant’s is Permissible”). Here, T suggests the combination with P to achieve a different advantage
 or result, i.e., waterproofing, from that discovered by applicant, i.e., reducing breakage.

The Potter patent application was filed on June 6, 2002, claiming subject matter invented by Potter.
 The Potter application properly claims priority to a German application filed on June 6, 2001. A first
 Office action contains a rejection of all the claims of the application under 35 USC 103(a) based on
 a U.S. patent application publication to Smith in view of a U.S. patent to Jones. A registered practitioner
 prosecuting the Potter application ascertains that the relevant subject matter in Smith’s published
 application and Potter’s claimed invention were, at the time Potter’s invention was made, owned by ABC
 Company or subject to an obligation of assignment to ABC Company. The practitioner also observes that
 the Smith patent application was filed on April 10, 2001 and that the patent application was published
 on December 5, 2002. Smith and Potter do not claim the same patentable invention. To overcome the rejection
 without amending the claims, which of the following timely replies would comply with the USPTO rules
 and the procedures set forth in the MPEP to be an effective reply for overcoming the rejection?
"
"
(A) A reply that only contains arguments that Smith fails to teach all the elements in the only independent
 claim, and which specifically points out the claimed element that Smith lacks. 
(B) A reply that properly states that the invention of the Potter application and the Smith application
 were commonly owned by ABC Company at the time of the invention of the Potter application. 
(C) A reply that consists of an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.132 stating that the affiant
 has never seen the invention in the Potter application before. 
(D) A reply that consists of an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.131 properly proving invention
 of the claimed subject matter of Potter application only prior to June 6, 2001. 
(E) A reply that consists of a proper terminal disclaimer and affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.130.

(B) is the most correct answer. See 35 USC § 103(a); MPEP §§ 706.02(l)(1) and 2145. The prior art exception
 in 35 USC § 103(c) is applicable because the Smith reference is only prior art under 35 USC § 102(e),

In accordance with the USPTO rules and the procedures set forth in the MPEP, which of the following is
 true?
"
"
(A) A claim to a process omitting a step in a disclosed process, where the step is disclosed in the specification
 to be essential to the invention, may not be properly rejected under 35 USC 112, first paragraph, for
 lack of enablement where the specification provides an enabling disclosure only for the process which
 includes the essential step. 
(B) Failure to disclose the best mode must rise to the level of active concealment or grossly inequitable
 conduct in order to support a rejection under 35 USC 112, first paragraph. 
(C) A claim failing to interrelate essential elements of the invention, as defined by the applicant in
 the specification, where the interrelation is critical to the invention may be properly rejected under
 35 USC 112, second paragraph, for failure to properly point out and distinctly claim the invention.
 
(D) Where the best mode contemplated by the inventor at the time of filing the application is not disclosed,
 a proposed amendment adding a specific mode of practicing the invention would not be new matter. 
(E) The best mode requirement is the same as the enablement requirement of the first paragraph of 35
 USC 112.
"

(C) is the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 2172.01, “a claim which fails to interrelate essential
 elements of the invention as defined by applicant(s) in the specification may be rejected under 35 USC
 112, second paragraph, for failure to point out and distinctly claim the invention. See In re Venezia,

(A) An objection and requirement to delete new matter from the specification is subject to supervisory
 review by petition under 37 CFR 1.181. 
(B) A rejection of claims for lack of support by the specification (new matter) is reviewable by appeal
 to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences. 
(C) If both the claims and the specification contain the same new matter, and there has been both a rejection
 and objection by the primary examiner, the new matter issue should be decided by petition, and is not
 appealable. 
(D) If both the claims and the specification contain the same new matter, and there has been both a rejection
 and objection by the examiner, the new matter issue is appealable, and should not be decided by petition.
 
(E) None of the above.

On January 2, 2001, a registered practitioner filed a patent application with the USPTO for inventor
 Beck. The application includes a specification and a single claim to the invention which reads as follows:
 
1. Mixture Y made by the process Q1. 
In the specification, Mr. Beck discloses that mixture Y has a
 melting point of 150° F. On June 2, 2001, the practitioner received an Office action from the primary
 examiner rejecting the claim. The claim is rejected under 35 USC 102/103 as being clearly anticipated
 by or obvious over Patent A. The examiner states “Patent A teaches mixture Y but made by a different
 process Q2.” Beck believes he is entitled to a patent to mixture Y. In accordance with USPTO rules and
 procedures set forth in the MPEP, which of the following would be the best reply to the rejection of
 his claim?
"
"
(A) An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F, supported by
 an affidavit showing that the mixture Y made by process Q2 exhibits a melting point of 300° F. 
(B) An argument that the processes used by applicant and patent A are different, supported by a third-party
 declaration stating only that the processes are different. 
(C) An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F, supported by
 a third-party declaration stating only that the products are different. 
(D) An argument that the processes used by applicant and patent A are different, supported by an affidavit
 showing that the mixture Y made by process Q2 exhibits a melting point of 300° F. 
(E) An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F because the
 claimed mixture Y has a melting point of 150° F and the mixture Y of patent A has a melting point of
 300° F.
"
"


(A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By- Process Claims Are Not Limited
 To The Manipulations Of The Recited Steps, Only The Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “‘even though
 product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability
 is based on the product itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production.
 If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior
 art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.’ In re
 Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).” The issue is whether the claimed mixture
 Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Once A Product
 Appearing To Be Substantially Identical Is Found And A 35 USC 102/103 Rejection Made, The Burden Shifts
 To The Applicant To Show An Unobvious Difference,” states “[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale
 tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art,
 although produced by a different process, the burden shifts to applicant to come forward with evidence
 establishing an unobvious difference between the claimed product and the prior art product. In re Marosi,
 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983).” Evidence that the two processes produce different
 properties is germane to the issue of patentability of the product-by-process claim. Accordingly, a
 comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process
 used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point
 would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical,
 in fact, they are patentably different. Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989).
 Therefore, the best reply to the outstanding rejection would be to argue that the claimed product has
 an unexpectedly lower melting point and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result
 of the patent A process is a mixture with higher melting point as compared to the claimed product.

 the date of the application in question. In accordance with USPTO rules and procedures set forth in
 the MPEP, which of the following arguments, if true, would overcome the rejection?
"
"
(A) The Foreman reference is nonanalogous art, but the reference may be reasonably pertinent to Barry’s
 endeavor to solving the particular problem with which Barry was concerned. 
(B) The rejection does not address a claimed limitation, and neither of the references teaches the claimed
 limitation. 
(C) The Barry patent issued after the filing date of the pending patent application. 
(D) The original specification states that the results achieved by the claimed invention are unexpected.
 (The statement is unsubstantiated by evidence). 
(E) The Foreman patent issued 105 years before the filing date of the pending patent application.

 foreign application. The reference is the foreign application. 
(B) The applicant files a foreign application, later timely files a U.S. application claiming priority
 based on the foreign application, and then files a continuationin- part (CIP) application, and the claims
 in the CIP are not entitled to the filing date of the U.S. parent application. The foreign application
 issues as a patent before the filing date of the CIP application and is used to reject the claims directed
 to the added subject matter under 35 USC 102(d)/103. The reference is the foreign application. 
(C) The applicant files a foreign application, and later timely files a U.S. application claiming priority
 based on the foreign application. The examined foreign application has been allowed by the examiner
 and has not been published before the U.S. application was filed. The reference is the foreign application.
 
(D) The reference is a defensive publication. 
(E) All of the above.

 a foreign application, later files a U.S. application claiming priority based on the foreign application,
 and then files a continuation - in - part (CIP) application whose claims are not entitled to the filing
 date of the U.S. parent, the effective filing date of the CIP application is the filing date of the

"
"


(D) is the correct answer. See MPEP § 2173.05(c), under the heading “Open-Ended Numerical Ranges.” Paraphrasing
 the explanation therein, when an independent claim recites a composition comprising “at least 20% iron”
 and a dependent claim sets forth specific amounts of non-iron ingredients which add up to100%, apparently
 to the exclusion of iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the
 percentages of the non-iron ingredients are based on the weight of the non-iron ingredients. On the
 other hand, a composition claimed to have a theoretical content greater than 100% (i.e., 20-80% of iron,
 20-80% of gallium, and 1-25% of copper) is not necessarily indefinite simply because the claims may
 be read in theory to include compositions that are impossible in fact to formulate. Here, because the
 invention is a non-theoretical alloy, the sum of the claimed constituents cannot exceed 100% unless
 the percentage is based on weight. In (D), the sum of elements (B) and (C) is 81% by volume, leaving
 only 19% for iron. Claim 1, however, requires “at least 20% iron,” rendering Claim 2 ambiguous as to
 the percentage of element A.

Office policy has consistently been to follow Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966),

(A) Determining the scope and contents of the prior art. 
(B) Resolving any issue of indefiniteness in favor of clarity. 
(C) Ascertaining the differences between the prior art and the claims in issue. 
(D) Resolving the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.

What happens If applicant doesn't designate a best mode, but puts forth several embodiment?

"


The application does not require a statement which specifically points out the best mode. 
MPEP 2165.01.
 There is no requirement in the statute that applicants point out which of their embodiments they consider
 to be their best; that the disclosure includes the best mode contemplated by applicants is enough to
 satisfy the statute. QUESTION 262 A French application was filed, then PCT application designating US
 filed claiming French application and IA was published in French. At some point within 30 months, without
 entering National Stage, applicant files continuation from PCT application, is the claim for French
 priority proper? Is it perfected? 
The claim for French priority is proper, but not perfected, since
 the filed continuation and USPTO only has the French application, they need to file translation to USPTO.
 
MPEP 1895.01. “A certified copy of the international application (and an English translation) of the
 international application may be required by the examiner to perfect the claim for benefit under 35
 USC 120 and 365(c) if the international application did not originate in the United States and such
 is necessary, for example, where an intervening reference is found and applied in a rejection of one
 or more claims. If the international application was published by the International Bureau pursuant
 to PCT Article 21, then a certified copy would not normally be necessary”. Rather than submitting national
 stage application papers under 35 USC 371, a continuing application (i.e., continuation, C-I-P, or division)
 under 35 USC 111(a) of the international (PCT) application may be filed. Pursuant to 35 USC 365(c),
 a regular national application filed under 35 USC 111(a) and 37 CFR 1.53(b) (not under 37 CFR 1.53(d)**)
 may claim benefit of the filing date of an international application which designates the United States.
 If benefit under 35 USC 119(e), 120 and 365(c) is also being claimed to an earlier filed national application
 (or international application designating the U.S.) via an intermediate international application designating
 the U.S., the examiner must examine the intermediate international application to see if it contains
 a proper reference to the earlier application. The reference will usually be included on the cover page
 of the published international application and/or may appear in the first sentence>(s)< of the description
 of the published application. A lack of a proper reference in the published international application
 does not necessarily mean that a proper reference is not contained in the second international application.

Answer, an amendment to the claim substituting for the term ""means for pulling the door open"" the structure

 as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure, material, or

 or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof. 
2173.05(i). The current view of the
 courts is that there is nothing inherently ambiguous or uncertain about a negative limitation. So long
 as the boundaries of the patent protection sought are set forth definitely, albeit negatively, the claim
 complies with the requirements of 35 USC 112, second paragraph. [...] The examiner has made a prima
 facie case of equivalent in the Office action to support the rejection based on 35 USC § 102. By amending
 the claim to no longer include the means limitation in question, the claim becomes narrower inasmuch
 as it no longer includes equivalents under 35 USC § 112, paragraph 6 for examination purposes.

Variation 1. An article about a special titanium baseball put on public display in a museum is published.
 Is it public use if only ""wealthy museum patrons who have no interest or skill to make baseballs"" see
 it, when the general public sees it, or people who have the interest/skill to make baseballs can see
 it? 

Variation 2. Article is published on Date W though not distributed. Article is put on display
 at museum on Date X, museum is only accessed at this time by wealthy museum patrons who don't have the
 skills to make baseballs (but the museum is a baseball museum). On Date Y, museum has a big PR event
 with news media etc. On Date Z, articles in museum are indexed and sorted. which date is the prior art
 date of the publication?
"
"
nan
"
"


MPEP 2133.03(a)(2.). The person to whom the invention is publicly disclosed need not understand the significance
 and technical complexities of the invention. A key to this question is also understanding that if a
 publication is only viewed by a few select members of the musuem club, then it is not PUBLIC and therefore
 does NOT qualify as a 102(a) or 102(b) publication. It doesn't matter if it is properly shelved and
 catalogued. Variation 3. The wealthy museum patrons who were allowed to view the baseball prior to the
 public grand opening were museum *members*, and the first viewing was opened to *members only*. 
MPEP
 2128.01, IV. In resolving whether or not a temporarily displayed reference that was neither distributed
 nor indexed was nonetheless made sufficiently publicly accessible to count as a “printed publication”
 under 35 USC 102(b), the court considered the following factors: “the length of time the display was
 exhibited, the expertise of the target audience, the existence (or lack thereof) of reasonable expectations
 that the material displayed would not be copied, and the simplicity or ease with which the material
 displayed could have been copied.” Note that ""printed publication"" as used above applies to 102(a) as
 well. 
Prior art date and public use date are two entirely separate issues. If the question asks for
 prior art date, then the answer is the date it is indexed and cataloged so someone can actually find
 it. If the question asks for the date of first public use, then the answer is the date the thing was
 displayed for museum patrons to see it, regardless whether the musuem is semi private.

2173.05(u). Claim [1] contains the trademark/trade name [2]. Where a trademark or trade name is used
 in a claim as a limitation to identify or describe a particular material or product, the claim does
 not comply with the requirements of 35 USC 112, second paragraph. The claim scope is uncertain since
 the trademark or trade name cannot be used properly to identify any particular material or product.
 A trademark or trade name is used to identify a source of goods, and not the goods themselves. Thus,
 a trademark or trade name does not identify or describe the goods associated with the trademark or trade

Examiner should withdraw both rejections in light of applicant's submissions. Examiner should withdraw
 enablement rejection, but keep written description as the application does not show how to make said
 chemical. Examiner should withdraw both rejections as neither were proper to begin with. MPEP 2161.
 The Federal Circuit reaffirmed that under 35 USC 112, first paragraph, the written description requirement
 is separate and distinct from the enablement requirement and gave an example thereof.). An invention
 may be described without the disclosure being enabling (e.g., a chemical compound for which there is
 no disclosed or apparent method of making), and a disclosure could be enabling without describing the
 invention (e.g., a specification describing a method of making and using a paint composition made of
 functionally defined ingredients within broad ranges would be enabling for formulations falling within
 the description but would not describe any specific formulation). 
Thus, by showing that a Phosita can
 make and use the chemical, the enablement requirement is satisfied and so that rejection should be dropped.

 rejection may stay. So B is the correct answer.

You are a registered patent agent with an office in Buffalo, New York. On January 13, 2008, Murphy, a
 resident of Japan, came to your office for purpose of obtaining a U.S. patent on her invention. She
 tells you that she first conceived her invention at her home in Ontario on December 18, 2006, and that
 she reduced it to practice on January 10, 2007, at her home. On January 13, 2008, Murphy provided you
 with a detailed written description fully disclosing her invention. You diligently proceeded to prepare
 the application. You filed the application in the PTO on February 12, 2008. Consider the situation presented
 below in light of the facts presented above and determine which paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 102, if any,
 would prevent Murphy from obtaining a U.S. patent. Murphy's invention is described and claimed in a
 Canadian Gebrauchsmuster petty patent granted on February 11, 2008, based on an application filed by
 Murphy on February 2, 2007. The Canadian Gebrauchsmuster patent was published on February 14, 2008.

(D) 35 U.S.C. § 102(e). 
(E) None of the above.

ANSWER: (C) is the correct answer. A Canadian Gebrauchmuster petty patent is usable in a 35 USC § 102(d)
 rejection. MPEP § 2135.01, subsection III. The foreign patent was granted prior to Murphy's U.S. filing
 date. MPEP § 2135.01, subsection 111, (E). Thus, Murphy's Canadian application was filed more than 12
 months prior to her U.S. filing date for the same invention and was granted before the U.S. filing date.
 (A), (B), and (D) are incorrect. 35 USC §§ 102(b), (c), and (e). (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.

On April 3, 2007, B discovered a process for making a new composition by heating an aqueous mixture of
 a resin and a metal salt. B filed a patent application on July28, 
2007, which issued as a patent on
 January l9, 2009. The patent claims were directed only to the process for making the composition. B's
 patent discloses, but does not claim, the composition. On September 19, 2008, X discovered that B's
 composition could be made by a different process comprising the steps of reacting a resin, a metal oxide,
 and an acid in a nitrogen atmosphere. On January 11, 2009, X filed an application in the PTO which claims
 the composition and his method of making the composition. All work by B and X was done in this country.
 X's work is independent of and not derived from B. X and B have never been employed by the same employer.
 The examiner rejected X's composition claims over B's patent under 35 U.S.C. § 102. The rejection is:
"
"
(A) improper because B discloses a process which is different from the process used by X to make the
 composition. 
(B) proper because B's composition was known by others in this country before the invention thereof by
 X. 
(C) improper because X filed his application before B's patent issued. 
(D) proper because B discloses, but does not claim the composition, and has an earlier filing date than
 X. 
(E) (B) and (D).
"
"


ANSWER: (D) is the correct answer, 35 USC § 102(e). (B) is not correct because ""known or used"" implies
 knowledge that is publicly accessible. B's composition was not publicly known. ""The statutory language
 'known or used by others in this country' (35 USC § 102(a)), means knowledge or use which is accessible
 to the public."" MPEP § 2132, subsection 1. [p.2100-66] citing Carelia v. Starlight Archery, 804 F.2d
 135, 231 USPQ 644 (Fed. Cir. 1986). There are no given facts showing that B's patent application was
 accessible to the public, 35 USC § 122, or that she disclosed her invention to the public before her
 patent issued. (A) is incorrect. Inasmuch as B's patent is not being used to reject X's claimed process,
 the difference in their processes does not show any impropriety in the rejection. (C) is incorrect.
 35 USC § 102(e). (E) is incorrect because (E) is incorrect.

Which of the following, published before the effective filing date of an application, is not an enabling
 prior art reference when used as anticipatory prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102
"
"
(A) A picture of a chair in a magazine. The magazine is published monthly in England. The picture shows
 all of the structural features recited in the application claims, and how they are put together. 
(B) Disclosure in a magazine article of the compound claimed in the application wherein only the compound
 is claimed. The magazine is published monthly in the United States. The article discloses a manner of
 making the compound which differs from the manner disclosed in the application. No utility for the compound
 is disclosed in the article. 
(C) Disclosure in a magazine article of a liquid named ""Rejuvinator Juice."" The magazine is published
 monthly in the United States. The article discloses that the liquid restores youth when ingested. The
 article does not disclose the composition or manner of making the liquid. The application has claims
 directed to a liquid composition which is described in the specification as restoring youth when ingested.
 
(D) The drawings in a U.S. design patent disclose all the structural features recited in the claims of
 the application. The drawings also show how the features are combined. 
(E) Disclosure of a table in a magazine published in the United States. The disclosure, including a picture,
 describes and shows how A of the claimed features are united in the table.
"
"


ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. Although the article names a liquid composition and discloses
 a utility for it, even an incredible utility, the article is not enabling because it does not disclose
 the composition or manner of making the liquid. In re Hoeksema, 158 USPQ 596 (CCPA 1968); MPEP § 2121.02.

In early 2007, X, a company based in Canada, developed a widget with increased reflective properties.
 X filed a patent application in the Canadian Patent Office on January 8, 2007, and filed a corresponding
 application in the USPTO on January 5, 2008. All research activities for the inventions disclosed and
 claimed in the U.S. and Canadian applications took place in Canada. The U.S. patent application contains
 five claims: 
1. A widget comprising elements A and B. 2. A widget according to Claim I wherein the
 widget further includes element D. 3. A widget comprising elements A and C. 4. A widget according to
 Claim 3 wherein the widget further includes element E. 5. A widget comprising elements A, B, and C.
 
The Canadian application only supports claims 1, 2, and 5 of the U.S. application. During the course
 of prosecution of the U.S. application, the examiner properly rejected all of the claims under 35 U.S.C.
 § 102(e) as being anticipated by a U.S. patent assigned to Z. The Z patent was granted on October 6,
 2008, on a U.S. application filed on June 15, 2007. The Z patent specifically describes, but does not
 claim, the widget in claims 1-5 of the U.S. application filed by X. The subject matter of the Z patent
 was reduced to practice in Monterey, California as of February 12, 2007. Which of the following proposed
 arguments or actions would properly overcome the examiner's § 102(e) rejection with respect to all the
 claims?
"
"
(A) File an affidavit under 37 CFR § 1.132 swearing behind the claims of the Z patent by relying on the
 2007 research activities of X in Canada. 
(B) File a claim for a right of priority based on the application filed in Canada along with a certified
 copy of the Canadian patent application and canceling Claims 3 and 4. 
(C) File a claim for a right of priority based on the application filed in Canada along with a certified
 copy of the Canadian patent application. 
(D) File an affidavit under 37 CFR § 1.132 swearing behind the February 12, 2007, reduction to practice
 date of the Z patent. 
(E) File a terminal disclaimer.
"
"


ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. MPEP §§ 706.02(b); 2136.05. (A) and (D) are incorrect because
 an affidavit under 37 CFR § 1.132 is inappropriate in this situation. MPEP § 715.01. (C) Will not result
 in overcoming the rejection of claims 3 and 4 inasmuch as the disclosure of the Canadian patent application
 only supported claims 1, 2, and 5. (E) is not correct because a terminal disclaimer will not overcome
 a 35 USC § 102(e) rejection. MPEP § 2136.05.

In which of the following situations, considered independently of each other, is the original, new, or
 amended claim supported in the application as filed?
"
"
(A) An amendment to the specification changing the definition of ""holder"" from ""is a hook"" to ""is a hook,
 clasp, crimp, or tong"" and no amendment is made of the claim, which uses the term ""holder."" The amendment
 is filed one month after the application was filed. There was no previous supporting disclosure in the
 specification of the holder being a clasp, crimp, or tong. 
(B) An amendment to the specification and claims changing the definition of ""holder"" from ""is a hoov'
 to ""is a hook, clasp, crimp, or tong."" The amendment is filed one month after the application was filed.
 There was no previous supporting disclosure in the specification of the holder being a clasp, crimp,
 or tong. 
(C) Original claim I in the application refers to ""a holder,"" and original claim 2 depends from and refers
 to claim I stating, ""said holder is a hook, clasp, crimp, or tong."" There is no disclosure in the specification
 preceding the claims in the application as filed for the holder to be a clasp, crimp, or tong. 
(D) An amendment is filed presenting a claim to an electrical insulating device, copied from a patent
 for the purpose of provoking an interference. The claim refers to ""nonconductive plastic holder."" The
 application as filed contains a broad generic disclosure describing electrical insulating devices. The
 holder is described in the specification of the application as ""conducting electricity."" There is no
 disclosure in the specification of the holder being ""nonconductive."" 
(E) All of the above.
"
"


ANSWER (C). MPEP § 2163.03, item 1. Original claims constitute their own description In re Koller, 613
 F.2d 819, 204 USPQ 702 (CCPA 1980). (A) and (B) are incorrect. As stated in MPEP § 2163.03, item 1,
 ""An amendment to the specification (e.g., a change in the definition of a term used both in the specification
 and claim) may indirectly affect a claim even though no actual amendment is made to the claim."" There
 is no supporting disclosure in the original description of the invention for the holder to a clasp,
 crimp, or tong. (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 2163.03, item IV. A broad generic disclosure is not necessarily
 a sufficient written description of a specific embodiment, especially where the broad generic disclosure
 conflicts with the remainder of the disclosure. Fields v. Conover, 443 F.2d 1386, 170 USPQ 276 (CCPA
 1970). (E) is not correct because (C) is correct.

X discovered that a silver insert for a metal cutting tool may be bonded (with a far superior bond strength
 over other known methods of attachment) to a steel tool holder. X filed a patent application on his
 invention which contained the following two claims: 
(1) A method of bonding a silver insert to a steel
 tool holder comprising the steps of 
providing a layer of polystick at the interface of the holder and
 insert, heating the holder, insert and polystick to a temperature of 250°F. and thereafter cooling the
 holder, insert, and polystick at a rate of between 12° and 13°F. per hour until a temperature of 120°F.
 is reached. (2) A silver insert bonded to a steel holder by the method of claim 1. 
The examiner rejected
 Claim 1 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over a U.S. patent to Y in view of a British patent
 to Z. The examiner rejected Claim 2 under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as being anticipated by the patent to Y.
 The patent to Y teaches that a silver insert is bonded to a steel tool holder by utilizing a layer of
 polystick at the interface of the insert and holder, but makes no mention of any particular temperatures.
 The patent to Z teaches that in a grinding tool, diamond chips may be ""securely fastened"" to a ceramic
 holder by applying a layer of polystick at the interface of the diamonds and holder, heating the holder,
 chips, and polystick to a temperature of 150°F. and thereafter ""slowly"" cooling the holder. Which of
 the following, if any, if submitted with a reply to the Office action, would be most persuasive and
 most likely overcome the examiner's rejection of Claim 2?
"
"
(A) Evidence that a gear-cutting Chine which includes a silver insert bonded to a steel tool holder as
 set forth in Claim 1 is outselling all other such Chines by a two-to-one margin. 
(B) An affidavit by X that, in his opinion, the patent to Z is inoperative. 
(C) Evidence that heavy advertising resulted in increased sales of X's invention. 
(D) An affidavit by X showing that there is a long felt need in the industry for X's silver insert to
 a steel tool holder. 
(E) None of the above.
"
"


ANSWER: (E) is the correct answer. MPEP §§ 2131.04; 706.02(b). Claim 2 was rejected as being anticipated
 by the patent to Y. As set forth in MPEP § 706.02(b), a rejection based on 35 USC § 102(b) can be overcome
 by ""(A) Persuasively arguing that the claims are patentably distinguishable from the prior art; or (B)
 Amending the claims to patentably distinguish over the prior art."" Evidence of secondary considerations
 is irrelevant to § 102 rejections and thus cannot overcome a rejection so based. MPEP § 2131.04, citing
 In re Wiggins, 488 F.2d 538, 543; 179 USPQ 421, 425 (CCPA 1973).

Which of the following statements concerning reliance by an examiner on common knowledge in the art,
 in a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103 is correct? 

I. Applicant can traverse an examiner's statement
 of common knowledge in the art, at any time during the prosecution of an application to properly rebut
 the statement.; 
II. An examiner's statement of common knowledge in the art is taken as admitted prior
 art, if applicant does not seasonably traverse the well known statement during examination.; 
III. If
 applicant rebuts an examiner's statement of common knowledge in the art in the next reply after the
 Office action in which the statement was made, the examiner can never provide a reference to support
 the statement of common knowledge in the next Office action and make the next Office action final.
"
"
(A) I. 
(B) II. 
(C) III. 
(D) I. and II. 
(E) None of the above.
"
"


ANSWER: (B) is the correct answer. MPEP § 2144.03. I. is incorrect because an applicant must seasonably
 traverse the well-know statement or the object of the well-known statement is taken to be admitted prior
 art. In re Chevenard, 60 USPQ 239 (CCPA 1943). Therefore (A) and (D) are incorrect. III is incorrect
 because the action can potentially be made final. Therefore (C) is incorrect. (E) is incorrect because
 (B) is correct.

Claimed subject matter has been properly rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over a combination of prior art
 references which render the claimed subject matter prima facie obvious. Which of the following actions
 by a practitioner in accordance with proper PTO procedure is most likely to be sufficient to overcome
 the prima facie case of obviousness?
"
"
(A) Filing a declaration under 3 7 CFR § 1. 132 containing evidence that the claimed subject matter possesses
 unexpected results, disclosed in the application, which are not described in the prior art, and arguing
 that the evidence rebuts the prima facie case. 
(B) Filing a reply arguing and giving your opinion that the claimed apparatus provides unexpectedly superior
 productivity. 
(C) Filing a declaration under 37 CFR § 1. 132 presenting evidence of superior properties for iron-containing
 compositions, disclosed in the application where the broad rejected claim is drawn to a ""metal-containing""
 composition. The prior art reference discloses and describes an aluminum composition which satisfies
 the broad claim, and the practitioner argues that the evidence rebuts the prima facie case of obviousness.
 
(D) Filing a declaration under 37 CFR § 1. 132 which demonstrates that a ""metallic"" apparatus of Claim
 I has superior properties to a plastic apparatus having all the structural limitations recited in the
 claim, and arguing that the evidence, which relies on properties disclosed in the application, rebuts
 the prima face case of obviousness, where Claim I was rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over references
 disclosing metallic apparatuses, and the references made out a prima facie case of obviousness. 
(E) Filing a declaration under 37 CFR § 1. 132 demonstrating commercial success of a telephone apparatus
 having a the structural limitations recited in the rejected claim except that the commercially successful
 apparatus is plastic and is disclosed in the application, whereas the rejected claim is limited to a
 ""metallic"" telephone apparatus, and arguing that the evidence rebuts the prima facie case of obviousness,
 where the claim was rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 over references disclosing metallic telephone apparatuses,
 and the references made out a prima facie case of obviousness.

As patent counsel for General Magnetic (GM), you filed a patent application in the PTO on January 2,
 1998 naming Brown as inventor, with claims directed to a method of treating equine fever. A primary
 Examiner rejected the application as lacking utility and also ""provisionally"" rejected the application
 under 35 USC 102(e)/103 in view of a commonly assigned application filed December 29, 1995, naming Brown's
 boss Cheryl Black as inventor. After discussing the matter with corporate counsel you filed a terminal
 disclaimer complying with applicable rules and disclaiming that part of the term of the Brown application
 which would extend beyond the expiration date of the commonly owned, copending Black application. The
 Black application was subsequently abandoned in favor of a CPA application on June 4, 1998. In the Brown
 application the examiner then withdrew the existing rejection and instead rejected all the claims as
 follows: (1) All the claims are rejected under 35 USC § 102(e)/103 as obvious over the CPA application
 in view of the patent to Blue. (2) All the claims are rejected under 35 USC § 102(e)/103 as obvious
 over another commonly owned patent to Black and Wilson in view of the patent to Blue. The examiner noted
 that the Blue patent and the Brown application are neither commonly owned nor have common inventor,
 and that both the Black and Wilson patent and the CPA application contain, but do not claim, the subject
 matter of the abandoned Black application. Which of the following would overcome the rejection:
"
"
(A) File a reply arguing that the withdrawal of the double patenting rejection coupled with the filing
 of the terminal disclaimer preclude a subsequent 102(e)/103 rejection. 
(B) File an affidavit under 37 CFR 1.131 by Brown establishing that the invention was conceived in South
 Africa and reduced to practice there between August 2, 1995 and December 14th of that same year. 
(C) File a delaration under 37 CFR 1.132 by Brown stating that he conceived or invented the subject matter
 disclosed but not claimed in the Black and Wilson patent and in the Black patent and its CPA. 
(D) File a declaration under 37 CFR 130 to disqualify the commonly owned references as prior art. 
(E) File a CPA of the Brown application.
"
"


ANSWER: (C) is the correct answer because if Brown invented the subject matter disclosed, but not claimed,
 in the prior art references, then that subject matter was not invented by ""another"" as required by 102(e).
 MPEP 2132.01. Remember if Brown's invention was not claimed in the prior art reference, then Brown cannot
 be named as an inventor in that prior art.

 of preventing cavitation of the impellers."" The examiner rejected the claim under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as
 being unpatentable over a patent to John in view of a patent to Alex. John teaches a rotary vane pump
 having impellers coated with epoxy resin for the purpose of preventing corrosion of the impellers. Alex
 teaches a mixing device having agitator blades coated with ceramic X for the purpose of preventing corrosion
 of the blades. Alex also suggests that the ceramic X coating material ""is useful on various types of
 pumps for the purpose of preventing corrosion."" The examiner determined that (i) it would have been
 obvious to one having ordinary skill in the art to substitute the ceramic X coating material 
taught
 by Alex for the epoxy resin coating material in John and (ii) the resultant rotary vane pump would have
 coated impeller blades which would inherently prevent cavitation. The combination of John and Alex:
"
"
(A) cannot support a prima facie case for obviousness unless the Alex reference contains a suggestion
 that ceramic X will cause cavitation. 
(B) cannot support a prima facie case for obviousness inasmuch as the discovery that ceramic X prevents
 cavitation imparts patentability to a known composition. 
(C) may support a prima facie case for obviousness even though the Alex reference does not disclose that
 ceramic X will prevent cavitation or can be used on the impellers of a rotary vane pump. 
(D) cannot shift the burden of proof to the applicant to show that the prior invention lacked the newly
 discovered property asserted for the claimed invention unless one of the references discloses the property.
 
(E) can support a prima facie case for obviousness only if both references show or suggest that ceramic
 X can be used in a rotary vane pump.

ANSWER: (C) is the correct answer. 35 USC § 103; MPEP §§ 2143; 21 ; 2145; In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688,
 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The motivation to modify the reference may suggest what the applicant
 has done, but for a different purpose. As discussed in MPEP § 2144 [p.2100-115], ""it is not necessary
 that the prior art suggest the combination to achieve the same advantage .... [citations omitted]"" (A),
 (B), (D) and (E) are incorrect because they are inconsistent with MPEP § § 2143, 2144, and 2145, as
 well as In re Dillon, supra.

On March 20, 2007, inventor B filed a patent application in the PTO claiming invention X. Inventor B
 did not claim priority based on a foreign application filed by inventor B on June 3, 2006, in the Patent
 Office of Canadiany. In the foreign application, inventor B disclosed and claimed invention X, which
 inventor B had conceived on October 10. 2005, and reduced to practice on January 5, 2006, all in Canadiany.
 The patent examiner issued an Office action where all the claims in the patent application were properly
 rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) and (e) as being anticipated by a U.S. patent granted to inventor
 Z on November 5, 2006. on a patent application filed in the PTO on February 6, 2005. There is no common
 assignee between Z and B, and they are not obligated to assign their inventions to a common assignee.
 Moreover, inventor Z, independently of inventor B, invented invention X, and did not derive anything
 from inventor B. The U.S. patent discloses, but does not claim, invention X. Which of the following
 is/are appropriate response(s) which could overcome the rejections under § 102 (a) and (e) when timely
 filed?
"
"
(A) Amend the claims to require particular limitations disclosed in inventor B's application, but not
 disclosed or suggested in inventor Z's patent, and argue that the limitations patentably distinguish
 the claimed invention over the prior art. 
(B) File an antedating affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR § 1.131 showing conception on October 10,
 2005, and reduction to practice on January 5, 2006, all in Canadiany. 
(C) File a claim for the right and benefit of foreign priority wherein the Canadian application is correctly
 identified, file a certified copy of the original Canadian patent application, and argue that as a result
 of the benefit of foreign priority, the U.S. patent is no longer available as a prior art reference
 against the claims. 
(D) (A), (B) and (C). 
(E) (A) and (C) only.
"

ANSWER: (A). By following the procedure in (A), the claims are no longer anticipated by Z's patent because
 particular limitations are now disclosed in inventor B's application which are not disclosed or suggested
 in inventor Z's patent. 35 USC § 102(a) and (e); MPEP 2131. ""A claim is anticipated only if each and

 prior art reference."" Verdegaal Bros V. Union Oil Co. of California, 2 USPQ2d 1051, 1053 (Fed. Cir.

 is the filing date of Z's patent (Feb. 5, 2005), which is prior to B's conception (October 10, 2005).
 35 USC § 102(e); MPEP 2136  ̄ 2136.05. (C) is not correct because the foreign priority date (June 3,
 2006) does not antedate the filing date (February 6, 2005) of Z's patent, which is the controlling date
 for purposes of overcoming the rejection under 35 USC §102(e). 35 USC § 119; MPEP 201.15. (D) is not
 correct because (B) and (C) are not correct. (E) is not correct because (C) is not correct.
