claw
==============================

computational law

Standard Operating Procedures
------------

To begin work:
In the iTerm command prompt, type the shortcut "claw".
This will:
 * open the claw folder within iTerm
 * open the claw environment so that software versions are consistent
 * open the claw git connection
Type "atom ." and the Atom editor will open to the claw folder.

To run python files:
In the iTerm command prompt, 
 * type "python scripts/script_name.py" to run a python file.
 * type "ipython -i scripts/script_name.py" to enter interactive mode. (Type "exit" to leave interactive mode.)

To open Jupyter notebooks:
In the iTerm command prompt, type "jupyter notebook" to open a browser displaying all notebooks.
Type ctrl+C to exit the jupyter notebook kernel.

To end work:
In the iTerm command prompt, type 
 * "git status" to show you what files you changed.
 * "git add data" if you added new files.
 * "git commit -a -m"commit message"" to commit the changed files to the local store.
 * "git push" to push the local changes to the git repository.
