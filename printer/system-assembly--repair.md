### Part 1 – Step 3. Connecting the X Axis Brackets to Z Profiles
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.

### Part 1 – Step 4. Assembling the X Rails on X Top Profiles
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.
* NOTE: did not use glue when screwing in screws.

### Part 1 – Step 5. Connecting the X Top Profiles to Z Profiles
* fast, easy assembly.
* revisited this step when tightening screws, careful to use right angle squares.

### Part 1 – Step 6. Assembling the Z Axis Top Brackets
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.

### Part 1 – Step 7. Connecting the Z Axis Top to Z Profiles
* fast, easy assembly.
* revisited this step when tightening screws, careful to use right angle squares.

### Part 1 – Step 8. Assembling the Z Axis Bottom Brackets
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.

### Part 1 – Step 11. Assembling the X Axis Bottom Profiles
* fast, easy assembly.
* NOTE: not sure the description of where to put the conical screws matches the picture. I went with the text (front left) rather than the picture (back right) because the front left metal piece has indentations for conical screws but the back does not.
* revisited this step when tightening screws, careful to use right angle squares.

### Part 1 – Step 13. Assembling the Y Axis
* fast, easy assembly.
* when printing test patterns, we noticed that circles came out warped, as ellipses. Modix said this is caused by the Y axis not being perfectly square. We 
  * loosened the front X idler and the set screw of the pulley connecting the front X belt to the X shaft,
  * loosened the front X belt, 
  * connected the Y axis to the frame using the calibration jigs, 
  * loosened the screws holding the Y axis profile to the X rails, 
  * retightened the X belt, 
  * retightened the Y axis screws,
  * retightened the pulley connecting the front X belt to the X shaft and the X idler, 
  * removed the calibration jigs. 
 This helped, but we also revisited this procedure after retightening the frame screws.

### Part 2 – 10. Installing the Support Brackets
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.
* revisited this step when tightening screws, careful to use right angle squares.
* NOTE: quantities of T-Nuts and 5M 12mm Screws are not accurate in the instructions.

### Part 2 – Step 11. Installing the Decorative Panels
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.

### Part 2 – Step 15. Tightening All Screws

### Part 2 – Step 16. Installing the Enclosure
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.

### Part 2 – Step 17. Assembling the Doors
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.

### Part 2 – Step 18. Assembling the Top Lid
* fast, easy assembly, though the instructions are not as thorough as before.
* The bottom lip of the back lid plate overlaps witht he back plate of the enclosure. Perhaps this is evidence of improper installation...

### Part 2- Step 19. Assembling the Top Pivoting Lid
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.

# Mechanical - Motors Belts & Pulleys
[Printer Systems List](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/README.md#system-assembly--repair)

### Part 1 – Step 2. Assembling the X Idler Pulleys
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.

### Part 1 – Step 9. Assembling the Z Axis Mid Brackets
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.
* NOTE: "2020 T-Nuts" does not specify M5 or M3; M5 chosen.

### Part 1 – Step 10. Assembling the Z Axis Sets
* fast assembly, but take extra care to not damage the ball screws.
* NOTE: did not use glue on screws.
* We had problems related to the ball screws and Z axis motors, and one of Modix's suggestions was to check that the ball screws did not fall all the way down to the bottom of the pillow bearings. If this happens, the bottom of the ball screw will cause additional friction, which can overpower the motors or just cause one of the ball screws to rotate less than the others, warping the bed angle and causing the motors to stop.
* We had problems with the pillow bearing set screws stripping and not holding the ball screws to the pillow bearings. We replaced the 3mmx3mm set screws with externally purchased 4mmx3mm set screws to add more contact surface area between the inside of the screw and the allen wrench, and used a new allen wrench. 
* [Troubleshooting - Z Motors Binding Up](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/troubleshooting-issues.md#z-motors-binding-up)

### Part 1 – Step 12. Installing the X Shaft
* fast assembly, be careful when installing to not damage any of the gears. No known issues.
* [Troubleshooting - Layer Shifts](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/troubleshooting-issues.md#layer-shifts)

### Part 1 – Step 14. Installing the Motors
* We did not initially tighten the set screws effectively to the flat sides of the motors, and consequently had problems with the motors turning without turning the gears, set screws feeling stripped, etc. We replaced the 3mmx3mm set screws with externally purchased 4mmx3mm set screws to add more contact surface area between the inside of the screw and the allen wrench, and used a new allen wrench. 
* Modix said to tighten the belts just tight enough to where they don't sag while stationary, and don't vibrate much while moving. I initially had them all too tight, causing extra friction.

* [Troubleshooting - Z Motors Binding Up](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/troubleshooting-issues.md#z-motors-binding-up)

### Part 1 – Step 15. Installing the Y Axis Timing Belt
* fast, easy assembly.
* We waited several more steps before trimming the excess belt since we did not have a spare/backup.
* Modix said to tighten the belts just tight enough to where they don't sag while stationary, and don't vibrate much while moving. I initially had them all too tight, causing extra friction.
* When re-tightening the belt, make sure to actually follow the directions and loosen the screw pushing against the Y motor and the Y motor screws. After the belt is hand-tightened, re-tighten the motor screws.
* [Troubleshooting - Layer Shifts](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/troubleshooting-issues.md#layer-shifts)

### Part 1 – Step 16. Installing the Timing Belt at the Back X Axis 
* fast, easy assembly.
* We waited several more steps before trimming the excess belt since we did not have a spare/backup.
* Modix said to tighten the belts just tight enough to where they don't sag while stationary, and don't vibrate much while moving. I initially had them all too tight, causing excess friction.
* When re-tightening the belt, make sure to actually follow the directions and loosen the screws holding the back X idler pulley. After the belt is hand-tightened, re-tighten the idler bracket.
* [Troubleshooting - Layer Shifts](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/troubleshooting-issues.md#layer-shifts)

### Part 1 – Step 17. Installing the Timing Belt at the Front X Axis
* fast, easy assembly.
* We waited several more steps before trimming the excess belt since we did not have a spare/backup.
* Modix said to tighten the belts just tight enough to where they don't sag while stationary, and don't vibrate much while moving. I initially had them all too tight, causing excess friction.
* When dealing with the Y axis not being perfectly perpendicular/parallel, we had to revisit this step and re-tighten the X axis belts. 
* When re-tightening the belt, make sure to actually follow the directions and loosen both the screws holding the front X idler pulley and the set screw on the gear. After the belt is hand-tightened, re-tighten the idler bracket and the pulley set screw.
* [Troubleshooting - Layer Shifts](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/troubleshooting-issues.md#layer-shifts)

### Part 3 – Step 4. Testing X & Y Homing
* fast, easy to perform the tests.
* We included testing of Z Home in this step, and discovered a problem with the Z motors binding up. This problem forced us to revisit several steps associated with motors and pulleys.

# Mechanical - Bed & Heater Box
[Printer Systems List](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/README.md#system-assembly--repair)

### Part 1 - Step 20. Installing the BLTouch Bed Leveling Sensor
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.
* Wiring of this step discussed in Wiring System description.

### Part 2 – Step 7. Installing the Silicon Heater
* slow assembly. Be careful not to damage the bed itself, or the heater, or the box.
* We tried to keep air bubbles from in between the bed heater and the bed, but it is difficult to know if this effort was successful.

### Part 2 – Step 8. Assembling the Bed
* slow assembly, be careful, especially since the bed is heavy, and both the bed and the ball screws are fragile.
* We bought a pair of levels to make sure the bed frame was level before tightening its screws or installing the bed.
* The bed is supposed to be positioned with a 10mm gap between the bed and the right side 2020 profile. However, the print head started 52mm from the left side of the bed and printed off the right side of the bed. Modix said that sliding the bed over toward the right would not damage the functionality of the Z motor system, so we slid the bed to the right ~5mm, until the heater contacted the angle brackets on the underside of the bed.

### Part 2 – Step 9. Installing the PEI Sheet
* slow assembly, requires 2 people.
* With two people and a roller, we still ended up with several air bubbles. Perhaps practice makes perfect, but revisit the instructions carefully. They definitely say it is better to leave it imperfect than to pull it up and try again. I have not yet looked up the proper technique for dealing with air bubbles.
* We also erroneously positioned the PEI sheet front-to-back, leaving ~2cm strips of exposed metal on either side. It is supposed to be positioned side-to-side, leaving strips of exposed metal on the front and back.

### Part 3 – Step 1. Temperature Controller Configuration
* fast assembly, seemingly easy but hard to know if you made a mistake.
* revisit this procedure for auto-tuning the bed heater.

### Part 3 – Step 2. Installing the Grounding Cable to the Print Bed
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.

# Electrical - Wiring Electronics Box & LCD Screen
[Printer Systems List](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/README.md#system-assembly--repair)

### Part 1 – Step 22. Assembling the LCD Screen
* fast, easy assembly, though you cannot complete the mounting of this step until after the enclosure is in place.
* The instructions do not specify which cable goes in which port, so I used blue painter's tape to label one.
* We had a relatively serious problem with the main button, in that the button would trigger the click action while turning. We removed the plastic cover from the button and have been using the metal knob underneath. 

### Part 1 – Step 23. Installing the Electronics Box and Drag Chains
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.
* NOTE: did not use glue when screwing in screws. We did already experience the vibration from the printer causing the three screws attaching the drag chain to the Y axis to shake themselves loose.
* After completing the wiring connections, we reopened the drag chains and repositioned the cables to lay smoothly.

### Part 2 – Step 1. Wiring the Motors and End Stops
* slow assembly, take the time to get this right.
* NOTE: did not use glue when screwing in screws. 
* When troubleshooting the Z motors, I replaced the stepper driver for the Z motors and needed to tune its voltage. Modix suggested using a multimeter set to 2V, touching the red pin to the Vref (phillips head screw in the center of the driver), touching the black pin to a GND pin on the stepper driver. If it's lower than 1.2V, turn the Vref (potentiometer)  clockwise, no more than 1/4 turn at a time. 
* [Troubleshooting - Z Motors Binding Up](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/troubleshooting-issues.md#z-motors-binding-up)

### Part 2 – Step 2. Checking the Controller Wiring
* slow assembly, take the time to get this right.
* see wiring diagrams for details. 

### Part 2 – Step 3. Wiring the Extruder
* slow assembly, take the time to get this right.
* see wiring diagrams for details. 

### Part 2 – Step 4. Installing the Electronics Box Cover
* fast, easy assembly. no known issues.
* see wiring diagrams for details. 

### Part 3 – Step 3. Turning on the Printer
* fast, easy assembly. no known issues.
* with the printer turned on, we can confirm that the LCD screen turns on, the hot-end fan turns on, and the electronics box fan turns on.

# Chemical - HotEnd Extruder & Filament
[Printer Systems List](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/README.md#system-assembly--repair)

### Part 1 – Step 18. Assembling the Hot-End
* the hot-end looks like the shrimp monster that was put into Neo's belly button in the Matrix.
* fast assembly, but the equipment is small and delicate so be careful not to break things or lose pieces.
* We still (01/22/2020) do not fully understand the ideal arrangement of heat sink, heat break and hot-end block. We have heat-tightened the nozzle, but the block still tries to spin when pushed, indicating that we have not fully threaded the threaded pieces correctly.
* NOTE: the kit only contains one heat sink, with a blue clip on it. Using this even though the instructions say "not the blue one"
* NOTE: I stripped a screw for the volcano block by putting it in the wrong side. Used a small screw from the Spares bag to replace.

### Part 1 – Step 19. Assembling the Extruder
* fast assembly, seemingly easy, but confusing, and if I made a mistake I probably wouldn't know how to recognize it.
* We initially assembled the hot-end without the thermal paste, then revisited and applied it. 
* Troubleshooting - 01/13/2020 - The extruder was making a screeching noise, and midway through a print would fail to grab the filament, ending the print. I took apart the extruder, repositioned the gears and filament tube, and noticed friction in the tube, possibly also at the end. After reassembly, the gears do not make the screeching noise, and the filament is successfully grabbed. I do not know how tight to tighten the adjustment screw, and still do not know the source of the problem for sure.

### Part 1 – Step 21. Installing the Extruder on the Y Axis Rail
* fast, easy assembly, no known issues.
* NOTE: did not use glue when screwing in screws.

### Part 2 – Step 5. Installing the Filament Sensor
* fast assembly, somewhat confusing.
* We do not have a foam dust filter installed, unsure exactly how to do so.
* We are not totally sure how the PTFE tube is supposed to sit in the extruder. When unloading filament using the Marlin command, the extruder runs backwards and kicks out not only the filament but also the PTFE tube. I was nervous about cutting the PTFE tube, and may have cut too much.
* We have had some trouble getting the extruder to grip the filament, and are unsure exactly how tight to tighten the extruder screw.
* We waited to install the filament sensor until the enclosure was complete.
* We had some trouble keeping the PTFE tube from snagging on the frame, especially when traveling from the front right side to the back right side. We installed two clips to the inside top of the enclosure lid, which seem to be keeping the PTFE tube out of snagging risk while also allowing the PTFE tube to reach all corners of the bed.

### Part 3 – Step 7. Heat Tightening the Nozzle
* fast assembly, somewhat confusing, seemed to work to prevent oozing.

# Software & Firmware

### Part 3 – Step 5. Terminal Software and Basic G-Code
* fast, easy assembly task. Pronterface works great, but does not appear to be necessary for normal workflow.
* [Troubleshooting - Z Motors Binding Up](https://github.com/elo-enterprises/hardware/blob/master/printer/troubleshooting-issues.md#z-motors-binding-up)

### Part 3 – Step 8. Printing Settings for Slicing Software
* instructions could use quite a bit more detail here. Refer to tables of variables for details.

### Part 3 – Step 9. Running Your First Print
* includes preferred settings for several variables, but does not appear to be comprehensive.

### Part 3 – Step 11. Updating the Modix Big-60-120X Firmware
* have not tried to do this yet.

### Part 3 – Step 14. Fine Tuning the Printer Dimension Accuracy
* have not tried to do this yet.

Firmware documentation website:

Video introduction to Pronterface recommended by Modix instructions:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj0R2RxSZco

### PrusaSlicer vs Slic3r vs Simplify3D
* The Prusa company, which makes 3D Printers, has forked the code for Slic3r and made a much nicer user interface. As Modix instructions suggested, we changed the mode to Expert to get access to all parameters.
* Simplify3D is proprietary software, recommended by Modix, but it is presently unclear why Modix prefers this software.

### PrusaSlicer vs Pronterface vs Marlin
It is not immediately clear to me how the various printer-related software interacts with each other. I get the impression that the goal is to allow the PrusaSlicer parameters to dominate the system. Thus 
Pronterface might not be necessary at all.
I don’t think PrusaSlicer can control the bed temperature.
I also think the UBL mesh data, along with the manual overrides to correct weak spots in the validate mesh pattern, are not entered into PrusaSlicer.

### Import an STL 3D Model File
I used File-Import-ImportSTL/OBJ/AMF/3MF/PRUSA to import a file,  terminator_pencil_holder_fixed.stl, and changed all three X/Y/Z scale factors to 25%. This STL file is 18,697 lines long and is human-unreadable in Atom; the file is the output of a 3D modeling tool that has been used to create a model of a terminator head hollowed out into a pencil holder.

### Export an INI PrusaSlicer Configuration File
I used File-Export-ExportConfig to produce a file, modix-terminator-config.ini, consisting of 235 lines of human-readable text that set values for alphabetically sorted parameters, specifying everything about the system except the details of the STL 3D model file(s), their position, scale, rotation, infill%, and support type.

### Create and Save a 3MF PrusaSlicer Project File
I used File-SaveProject to produce a file, modix-terminator-project.3mf, that is an executable for PrusaSlicer. If you make changes to the project in the project file, any .ini files you have created will not be updated.

### Slicing
I used SliceNow to slice the object. PrusaSlicer breaks it down into printer-relevant “feature types”:
* Perimeter
* External Perimeter
* Overhang Perimeter
* Internal Infill
* Solid Infill
* Top Solid Infill
* Bridge Infill
* Gap Fill
* Skirt
* Support Material
* Support Material Interface
* Wipe Tower
* Custom

### Export a GCODE Output File
I used ExportGCode to create a file, modix-terminator.gcode, consisting of 98,227 lines of code telling the printer every last little thing it has to do in what order with what parameter settings. While GCode is tedious, it is human readable, and there are lists of GCode commands e.g. http://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M206.html. 

### Parameters
A PrusaSlicer Configuration Snapshot is the collection of slicer version information, plus 
* Print settings
* Filament settings
* Printer settings
